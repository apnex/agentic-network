/**
 * IAgentClient — Layer-7 session surface for the network-adapter package.
 *
 * Phase 1: types only. Zero runtime change. The implementation that
 * satisfies this interface is the current `UniversalClientAdapter`,
 * which will be refactored in Phase 3 to own the session FSM itself
 * (currently delegated down to McpConnectionManager).
 *
 * ## Responsibility boundary
 *
 * An AgentClient sits between a shim (the application-side adapter for
 * Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.) and an `ITransport`. It owns:
 *
 *   1. The session FSM (disconnected → connecting → synchronizing →
 *      streaming → reconnecting). Phase 3 moves this out of
 *      `McpConnectionManager` and into the AgentClient implementation.
 *   2. Role registration and the enriched handshake that binds a session
 *      to an engineerId + sessionEpoch.
 *   3. State sync on entry to `synchronizing` (get_task,
 *      get_pending_actions, state reconciliation).
 *   4. Session-level reconnect policy on top of the wire: retry-once on
 *      `session_invalid`, drive the FSM across wire bounces, coordinate
 *      displacement checks (wasCreated / sessionEpoch monotonicity).
 *   5. Event classification, dedup, and routing into the shim's
 *      actionable/informational/state callbacks.
 *   6. Discovery translation — turn `ITransport.listMethods()` into the
 *      typed tool surface the shim consumes.
 *
 * It is NOT responsible for:
 *
 *   - Wire framing, SSE keepalive watchdogs, HTTP retries. All of that
 *     lives in the Transport below.
 *   - Shim-specific UX or side effects (toast formatting, prompt
 *     injection, persistence). Those live in the shim above.
 *
 * ## Shim-facing surface
 *
 * A shim is handed an `IAgentClient` and sees only `call(method, ...)`,
 * the session-state stream, and the classified-event callbacks. It
 * does not see `ITransport` and must not. Phase 6 renames the existing
 * `IClientShim` consumers onto `IAgentClient` to make this explicit.
