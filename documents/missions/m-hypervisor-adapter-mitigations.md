# Mission: M-Hypervisor-Adapter-Mitigations

> **Live state tracked in `docs/traces/m-cognitive-hypervisor-work-trace.md`** — read that first for the up-to-date in-flight / queued / done picture across sessions. This brief documents the mission's scope, sequencing rationale, and the three architect refinements absorbed on thread-235 convergence.

**Hub mission id:** mission-38 (with mission-37 as an apparent duplicate-on-creation; see §7 for the drift note).
**Proposed:** 2026-04-20 (thread-233 + thread-235 ratification)
**Proposed by:** Architect
**Owner:** Engineer (implementation); Architect (directive issuance + task-level review)
**Governance:** Director approves mission kickoff; Architect issues per-task directives; Engineer implements + reports.
**Peer of:** M-Cognitive-Hypervisor (the Hub-side stability arc). This mission is the adapter-side arc targeting bug-11.

## 1. Goal

Close the **cognitive-layer silence class** of bug-11 — specifically, the `auto_thread_reply_failed` ("exceeded tool-call rounds without converging") class that fired 10× during M-Ideas-Audit (2026-04-19). bug-10's fix was transport-only; bug-11 is the sibling class at the cognitive layer.

**Success criteria:**
- Every one of the 10 observed failure modes in the bug-11 body is either (a) prevented by one of the landed mitigations or (b) gracefully handled without the LLM's user-visible context being disturbed.
- tele-2 ("Frictionless Agentic Collaboration") becomes achievable — tool-round exhaustion ceases to be the dominant false-positive class on the Director-notification surface.

## 2. Scope

The six mitigations in scope (mitigation #7 is out of scope for this mission — it lands under Phase E / idea-114 / ADR-020):

1. **Round-budget awareness** — adapter injects `[Budget: N/M]` tag per LLM turn; LLM self-paces.
2. **Parallel tool calls** — adapter batches independent calls into a single Gemini parallel-call turn.
3. **Tool-result caching** — short-TTL cache on read-only tools (`get_thread`, `list_*`) to reduce round burn from exploratory reads.
4. **Chunked reply composition** — detect response-scope; split complex replies across turns when exceeding safe output bounds.
5. **Budget-exhaustion grace** — emit `[SAVE_STATE]` synthetic + flag queue item `continuation_required` so exhausted sessions can resume without losing progress.
6. **Tool-error elision** — adapter catches schema-rejection + gate-rejection, corrects + retries without surfacing to the LLM. Mechanized by CP2 C2's `ThreadConvergenceGateError` structured format (subtype + remediation + metadata).

Mitigation #7 (pre-hydration) is already scoped under Phase E / idea-114 / ADR-020 — not duplicated here.

## 3. Tasks + sequencing

Locked on thread-233 with three refinements absorbed on thread-235. Sequencing prioritizes Error Elision first (highest stability impact; CP2 C2 made it mechanizable); ends with Hub-side continuation primitives (1b — smallest-blast-radius change left).

### Task 0/3 — Measurement + Error Elision (task-310)

Combined deliverable — the measurement primitive is a prerequisite for quantifying every other mitigation's impact.

**Measurement scope:**
- Adapter-side `tool_rounds_exhausted` telemetry counter.
- Longitudinal metadata per event: timestamp, threadId, correlationId, role, final round count at exhaustion, last-attempted tool name. Allows frequency analysis over time + correlation with specific threads / tool patterns.
- Wired at `agents/vertex-cloudrun/src/sandwich.ts` where `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS_SENTINEL` is currently only audit-logged to the Hub.

**Error Elision scope:**
- Parse structured JSON returned by `create_thread_reply` rejection (CP2 C2 format: `{success:false, error, subtype, remediation, metadata?}`).
- Emit a new `thread_reply_rejected_by_gate` telemetry event with the subtype + remediation for forensic correlation.
- **v1:** do not yet auto-correct — measurement + structured surfacing only.
- **v2 (Task-310 follow-up or separate task):** per-subtype auto-correct rules (e.g., `summary_missing` → synthesize from message history; `stage_missing` → auto-stage `close_no_action`). Deferred because the auto-correct rules need per-subtype design discussion + tests.

### Task 2 — Parallel Dispatch + Caching

**Parallel dispatch:** adapter concurrency manager batches independent tool calls in a single Gemini parallel-call turn. Today the vertex-cloudrun shim serializes tool calls; Gemini supports `parallel_tool_calls`.

**Caching (architect-refined):** dual-trigger invalidation — short TTL (30s default, configurable) + write-action detection in the adapter's own thread history (`create_thread_reply`, `update_*`, cascade spawns) invalidates the cache entry before the next read. Strictly conservative: any agent-observable write busts the cache; no write-timestamp drift tolerance. Scope limited to read-only tools (`get_thread`, `list_tasks`, `list_threads`, `list_ideas`, `list_missions`, `list_proposals`, `list_bugs`, `list_audit_entries`, `list_tele`, `list_turns`).

**Pre-claim design discussion:** the cache-invalidation rule should be reviewed once on a thread before implementation lands — small surface, but the "cross-agent write outside my own history" case needs a decision (TTL alone catches it; write-detection doesn't).

### Task 1a — Budget Awareness (adapter-side)

**Dynamic budget reflection (architect-refined):** prompt injection of `[Budget: round_count/max_rounds]` tag, recomputed per turn from the active thread's context rather than static-at-session-start.

**Pure adapter scope:** no Hub primitives required. Injected in the system prompt segment that the vertex-cloudrun shim composes per turn.

### Task 4 — Chunked Reply Composition

Detect when the LLM's generated `create_thread_reply` args exceed safe output bounds; split into chunks that post across consecutive turns while preserving the original convergence intent. Ensures full-context replies can land even when individual chunks would otherwise exceed limits.

### Task 1b — Graceful Exhaustion (Hub-side)

Hub-side continuation primitives:
- New queue-item state transition: `continuation_required` (budget exhausted mid-turn).
- Resumption payload format that captures LLM state snapshot for restart.
- Adapter emits `[SAVE_STATE]` synthetic marker when round-budget hits a critical threshold (e.g., 2 rounds remaining) so the continuation point is graceful.

Landed last because it introduces new queue-item semantics that Tasks 0–4 don't require.

## 4. Integration with M-Cognitive-Hypervisor

- **CP2 C2 (shipped):** `ThreadConvergenceGateError` structured subtype + remediation + metadata. This mission's Task 0/3 (Error Elision half) consumes that surface directly.
- **CP1 (shipped):** metrics primitive + shadow-invariant logger. Task 0/3's `tool_rounds_exhausted` counter lives in `CognitiveTelemetry` (adapter-side); cross-correlation with Hub `inv_th19.shadow_breach` + `convergence_gate.*` buckets is via the shared `threadId` in the telemetry event metadata.
- **Phase E / idea-114 / ADR-020:** pre-hydration (mitigation #7) lives under that Phase, not here.

---

## 5. Test strategy

- **Adapter-layer unit tests:** Each task lands with unit tests in `packages/network-adapter/test/` (for adapter-layer work) or `packages/cognitive-layer/test/` (for telemetry additions).
- **Integration tests:** vertex-cloudrun shim has end-to-end tests in `agents/vertex-cloudrun/test/` that exercise the LLM loop against a fake Gemini client.
- **Hub-side Task 1b tests:** land in `hub/test/` alongside the continuation-primitive unit tests for the state FSM.
- **Fault-injection for Error Elision (Task 0/3 v2):** introduce a subtype-specific fault injector that can force each `ThreadConvergenceGateError` subtype to trigger in tests, so the auto-correct rules have coverage before shipping.

---

## 6. Bug / idea / ADR linkage

- **bug-11** — the critical-severity parent bug; resolution gated on this mission landing.
- **idea-132** — the triaged proposal this mission formalizes. Expected Hub transition `triaged → incorporated` with `missionId: mission-38` at architect discretion (tool ACL is architect-only for that flip).
- **ADR-017** — persist-first comms queue; Task 1b's `continuation_required` state extends the queue FSM and should land with an ADR addendum.
- **ADR-018** — cognitive layer middleware; every middleware change in this mission conforms to ADR-018 invariants (non-blocking emission, queueMicrotask sinks, etc.).

---

## 7. Drift note — duplicate missions

During the 2026-04-20 23:30Z formalization flow, two missions with the same title (`M-Hypervisor-Adapter-Mitigations`) landed 2 minutes apart:

- **mission-37** — created 23:30:16Z. Has `documentRef: "documents/missions/m-hypervisor-adapter-mitigations.md"` (this file). No tasks attached.
- **mission-38** — created 23:32:17Z. Has `task-310` attached. `documentRef: null`.

The engineer is proceeding against **mission-38** (the one carrying `task-310`) and referencing this brief from the filesystem path. Architect should: (a) attach `documentRef` to mission-38, (b) mark mission-37 as `archived` or reuse it, and (c) perform the `update_idea` transition on `idea-132` (`triaged → incorporated` with `missionId: mission-38`). All three transitions are architect-only per the current Hub ACL. Not a blocker for task-310 implementation.
