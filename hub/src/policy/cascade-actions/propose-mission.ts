/**
 * Cascade ActionSpec: propose_mission.
 *
 * Spawns a Mission in `proposed` status. Distinct from Director-
 * gated `create_mission` — autonomous actions cannot widen authorization
 * scope; Mission stays in `proposed` until Director activates.
 *
 * Payload: { title, description, goals } — goals serialised into
 * description as a Markdown list until the Mission schema grows a
 * first-class goals field.
