/**
 * Cascade handler: propose_mission (M24-T9, ADR-014).
 *
 * Spawns a Mission in `proposed` status. Distinct from the Director-
 * gated `create_mission` which bypasses the proposal stage; per
 * ADR-014 §21, autonomous actions cannot widen authorization scope —
 * proposing a mission still requires Director activation to become
 * `active`, preserving the scope boundary.
 *
 * Payload shape: { title, description, goals }
 *   - `goals` is serialised into the Mission's `description` field as
 *     a Markdown-formatted list. Mission schema doesn't yet carry a
 *     first-class `goals: string[]` field; when it does, handler
 *     flips to pass goals through separately (no behaviour change for
 *     consumers of createdMission.description).
