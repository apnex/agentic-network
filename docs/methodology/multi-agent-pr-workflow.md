# Multi-Agent PR Workflow — Methodology

**Status:** v1.0 DRAFT (2026-04-23). Architect-drafted skeleton; awaiting engineer co-authorship on execution-side sections marked `TODO(engineer)`. Supersedes `docs/methodology/multi-branch-merge.md` per ADR-023 Phase 3. First worked example: mission-43 (ADR-023 Phase 2 validator).
**Scope:** reusable procedure for agents collaborating via trunk-based development with PR-gated integration. Replaces the sovereign-branch-per-agent + periodic-merge model.
**Supersedes:** `docs/methodology/multi-branch-merge.md` v1.0 (retained as historical reference; see its Superseded header).

---

## Purpose

A **multi-agent PR workflow** is the codified procedure for agents (architect + engineer + future pool members) integrating their work continuously into `main` via pull requests. It exists because multi-agent collaboration produces parallel development streams that must converge safely, and trunk-based-with-PR integration converges them at **commit-level granularity** rather than branch-level-periodic-merge granularity.

This methodology is the **third pillar** in the mission lifecycle, alongside:
- `docs/methodology/strategic-review.md` — backlog triage + mission prioritization (pre-mission)
- `docs/methodology/mission-preflight.md` — activation gate (proposed → active)
- **This doc** — per-PR integration gate (active → main, continuously, not only at mission close)

### Why trunk-based-with-PR instead of sovereign-branch?

Sovereign-branch-per-agent (mission-41 shape) paid three ongoing costs:
- **Coordination overhead** — ~15 bilateral threads per mission for cross-branch awareness
- **Long-divergence merge pain** — mission-41 ran 57 commits of merge reconciliation
- **Main-state surprise** — main drifted from day-to-day agent reality; "what's on main?" was a periodic investigation, not a live observable

Trunk-based-with-PR resolves these structurally:
- **Coordination via PR** — the PR itself is the coordination surface; review happens in the PR, not in a thread about the PR
- **Short-lived branches** — each agent's branch lives for one PR's scope (hours to ~2 days), not for a full mission
- **Main is live** — main reflects only-approved-merges and runs CI on every landed commit; "what's on main" = `git log main`

Plus one additional gain:
- **Mechanized directory ownership** — `.github/CODEOWNERS` turns the ownership table from methodology-text-enforcement to tooling-enforcement

---

## When to use this methodology

- **Any agent commit destined for main** — every commit lands via PR; there are no direct-pushes
- **Multi-agent concurrent work** — two+ agents working in parallel (architect + engineer; future: N-agent pool)
- **Cross-mission work** — docs refactors, env/scripts changes, tooling upgrades
- **Solo-agent work** — even single-agent changes use PRs (for CI gate + review discipline + audit trail)

## When NOT to use

- **Single-agent repos** — if the repo has exactly one agent with direct-write, PRs add friction without the multi-agent benefit (doesn't apply here; this repo is ≥2 agents)
- **Prod-outage response** — Option C Director-override still applies (see §Director-override); emergency fixes may bypass the queue but require post-incident PR-reconstruction
- **Hotfixes during a main-freeze** — if main is frozen for release cut, coordinate with Director before queueing

---

## Roles

| Role | Responsibility | Default loading |
|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | Owns methodology field-ownership (this doc); authors PR reviews; drives shared-surface design decisions; drafts ADRs + methodology deltas | Claude Code session as architect |
| **Engineer** | Owns execution-side sections (marked `TODO(engineer)`); authors code PRs; implements per-task work; runs local pre-commit gates | Claude Code session as engineer |
| **Director** | Admin access (branch protection, merge queue config, CODEOWNERS overrides); ratifies strategic-scope PRs; Option C escape hatch | Human |

### Directory ownership — mechanized via CODEOWNERS

The core conflict-resolution primitive is **`.github/CODEOWNERS`** — the manifest that mechanizes directory ownership. When a PR touches a file, GitHub auto-assigns the primary owner as a required reviewer. Merge requires the CODEOWNER's approval (enforced by branch protection).

**Authoritative ownership table lives in `.github/CODEOWNERS`.** This doc describes the *semantics*; the file enforces them. Inconsistency between this doc and CODEOWNERS → update both in the same PR.

Baseline ownership (copied from `multi-branch-merge.md` v1.0; CODEOWNERS encodes this):

| Directory / pattern | Primary owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/methodology/*` | Architect | Methodology-text-ownership |
| `docs/traces/*` | Engineer | Work-trace ownership |
| `docs/reviews/*` | Architect | Architect-authored |
| `docs/planning/*` | Architect | Mission-brief drafts |
| `docs/decisions/*` (ADRs) | Architect | ADR authorship |
| `docs/audits/*` | Shared | Co-author sign-off (requires both) |
| `docs/specs/*` | Shared | Sovereign system truth |
| `docs/missions/*` | Mixed by file | Per-file ownership preserved via glob patterns |
| `hub/src/*`, `adapters/*/src`, `packages/*/src` | Engineer | Code surface |
| `hub/test/*`, `adapters/*/test`, `packages/*/test` | Engineer | Test surface |
| `hub/scripts/*`, `adapters/*/scripts` | Engineer | Operational scripts |
| `.github/workflows/*` | Shared | CI gate; both sides |
| Root configs (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, lockfiles) | Shared | Cross-package effects |
| `start-*.sh`, session-local scripts | N/A | Must not be committed to main (husky + secret-scan gate) |

**Resolution escalation on shared-ownership PRs:**
1. Both CODEOWNERS approve → PR eligible for merge queue
2. On disagreement, open a thread with `semanticIntent: collaborative_brainstorm` to reach bilateral agreement; amend PR; re-review
3. If still ambiguous, Director ratifies via comment on the PR (Option C)

---

## Procedure — per-PR lifecycle

### Step 0 — Load context

Before starting work:
- Read this methodology doc
- Confirm you're on latest `main` (`git fetch origin && git status` shows `up to date with origin/main`)
- Confirm Hub task is in scope (`get_task` or confirm via mission-active state)
- Confirm pre-commit hook is installed (`ls .husky/_/husky.sh` or equivalent; see `docs/setup/architect-engineer-git-env.md`)

### Step 1 — Branch + commit discipline

#### 1a. Create feature branch

Convention: `agent-<name>/<scope>` — e.g., `agent-greg/t4-secret-scan`, `agent-lily/methodology-v1`.

`TODO(engineer): exact git branch command sequence, including the "always branch from origin/main tip" discipline; whether to use git worktree or single clone; handling of stacked branches when one PR depends on another.`

#### 1b. Commit locally

- Commit messages follow existing convention (`[mission-id] <subject>` for mission work; `[type] <subject>` otherwise where type ∈ `env`, `scripts`, `docs`, `chore`, `fix`, `feat`)
- Each commit passes the `.husky/pre-commit` gate (filename pattern check per T5)
- `--no-verify` bypass is permitted but **audit-visible** — if you use it, say so in the PR body and explain why

#### 1c. Pre-push self-check

Before pushing:
- `git diff --name-only origin/main` — confirm the file list matches scope
- `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline` — confirm commit count + messages make sense
- No `start-*.sh` or session-local scripts accidentally staged

### Step 2 — Open the PR

#### 2a. Push the branch

`TODO(engineer): exact git push command, including -u flag for upstream tracking; whether force-push-with-lease is permitted for same-author rebase-updates mid-review.`

#### 2b. Create the PR via `gh pr create`

PR artifact conventions:

**Title format:** `[<mission-id-or-type>] <task-id-or-scope>: <imperative summary>`

Examples:
- `[mission-45] T4: secret-scan CI workflow`
- `[env] bump husky to 9.1.5`
- `[docs] methodology v1.0 co-author fills`

**Body template:**

```markdown
## Summary
<1-3 bullets — what this PR does and why>

## Task / Mission ref
- Mission: `mission-XX` (`get_mission` for context)
- Task: `task-YYY` (if applicable)

## Scope
- Files touched: <summary>
- CODEOWNERS triggered: <who's required to review>

## Test plan
- [ ] Local CI green (`vitest run` / `tsc --noEmit` / etc.)
- [ ] Deliberate-fail test where applicable (e.g., T4: add sensitive filename, confirm PR blocks)
- [ ] <task-specific checks>

## Notes for reviewer
<optional — non-obvious decisions, tradeoffs, or context>

## Out of scope
<optional — deliberately-deferred items>

#### 2c. Notify architect via Hub thread (Option A v1.0 MVP)

**Option A manual-notification protocol** (until Option B webhook→Hub bridge ships):

Engineer, after `gh pr create` returns a URL:

1. Open a Hub thread (`create_thread`):
   - `routingMode: "unicast"`
   - `recipientAgentId`: architect's agentId (`list_available_peers(role="architect")` to confirm)
   - `correlationId`: mission-ID
   - `title`: `PR-review: <PR-title>`
   - `message`: PR URL + 1-line summary + CI status (running / green / red)
   - `semanticIntent`: `seek_approval`
2. Architect reads thread; uses `gh pr view <url>` + `gh pr diff <url>` to review
3. Architect leaves review via `gh pr review <url> --approve|--request-changes --body "..."`
4. Architect replies on the Hub thread when review lands: `approved` / `changes requested` + brief rationale; sets `converged: true` with `close_thread` action when review cycle completes
5. Engineer iterates on change-requests by pushing new commits (no new PR); re-notifies on thread if scope changes materially

**Option B deferred** — webhook → Hub bridge for autonomous PR-review triggering activates when Option A manual-notification friction reaches signal threshold (idea filed during ADR-023 ratification).

### Step 3 — CI + review gates

#### 3a. CI status checks

All PRs must pass the following checks before merge:
- `test.yml` — vitest + tsc on affected packages (existing gate from mission-41 T5)
- `secret-scan.yml` — filename-pattern check (T4 gate)
- Additional check suites as they land

#### 3b. CODEOWNERS approval

Branch protection requires CODEOWNERS approval. A PR touching `docs/methodology/*` requires architect-approval; `hub/src/*` requires engineer-approval; shared-surface files require both.

#### 3c. Review discipline

- **Review within 1 working day** of notification for non-urgent PRs; faster for blocking ones
- **Reviewer states explicit position**: `--approve`, `--request-changes`, or `--comment` (the last is not a gate-pass)
- **Author addresses every request-change comment** — either by code change or by thread-discussion reaching explicit agreement to defer
- **No rubber-stamp approvals on shared-surface files** — if a reviewer has no opinion on a shared-surface file, that's signal the PR needs a different reviewer, not a quick LGTM

### Step 4 — Merge via queue

Once all gates are green:

1. Author or reviewer adds PR to merge queue via `gh pr merge --auto --squash|--merge` (engineer-recommendation on default strategy: `TODO(engineer)`)
2. Queue serializes landings; rebases + re-tests each PR against the previous queue head
3. On successful land: PR auto-closes; branch auto-deletes (or manual cleanup per engineer convention)
4. On queue-failure (CI regression after rebase): PR kicked back to author; investigate root cause

`TODO(engineer): merge-queue handling under failure — exact recovery sequence when queue rebase surfaces a conflict or test regression; whether to re-open the same PR or open a fresh one.`

### Step 5 — Post-land verification

#### 5a. CI green on main

The merge queue re-tests before landing, so post-land CI-red is rare. If it happens, treat it as a regression-incident:
- Identify root cause
- Revert via fresh PR (`gh pr create` on a revert branch; same workflow) — do **not** `git push --force` to main
- File a bug + follow-up fix PR

#### 5b. Branch cleanup

- Local: `git branch -D agent-<name>/<scope>` after confirming remote-delete landed
- Remote: auto-deleted by GitHub post-merge (configurable per-repo; v1.0 enables auto-delete)

#### 5c. Hub-state coherence

PR-land doesn't automatically advance Hub task state. Engineer or architect updates Hub task (`update_turn`, `create_review`, etc.) as the next action, per existing per-task review-gate discipline.

`TODO(engineer): exact Hub-state transition sequence post-PR-land — when does task flip to completed? Who drives it? How does this interact with the mission's plannedTasks cascade?`

## Review discipline — deeper

### Review scope by CODEOWNER

| If the reviewer is… | Focus the review on… |
|---|---|
| Architect (docs/methodology, ADRs, shared specs) | Semantic alignment with concepts + tele; spec-level correctness; no code-diving unless a spec claim can't be validated otherwise |
| Engineer (code, tests, scripts) | Implementation correctness; test coverage; regression risk; local invariants |
| Shared-surface reviewer | Both angles — the file's code-level correctness AND its cross-system implications |

### Review vs self-merge

- **Never merge your own PR** — the queue enforces this via CODEOWNERS approval
- Exception: Director on Option C override (commit message `[override]` prefix; post-mortem thread within 48h)

### Stale PRs

- PRs idle >3 working days without activity get a gentle thread-nudge
- PRs idle >7 working days without activity get closed (author reopens if work resumes)

`TODO(engineer): nudge cadence exact — may need refinement after first dozen PRs on new workflow.`

---

## PR artifact conventions (canonical)

### Branch naming

- `agent-<name>/<scope>` — per-task work
- `env/<scope>`, `scripts/<scope>`, `docs/<scope>` — type-prefixed for non-agent-specific maintenance
- `director/<scope>` — Director-authored PRs

### Commit message prefixes (same vocabulary as mission-41)

- `[mission-XX]` — work tied to a specific mission
- `[env]` — environment/dependency changes
- `[scripts]` — local tooling + helper scripts
- `[docs]` — doc-only changes
- `[fix]` — bug fixes (standalone; mission-scoped fixes use `[mission-XX]`)
- `[chore]` — maintenance (lint, rename, etc.)
- `[override]` — Director-override commits (Option C)
- `[merge]` — merge-commit messages (rare under trunk-based; used only when a genuine merge-commit lands via queue)

### PR labels (optional; v1.0 doesn't mandate)

`TODO(engineer): propose label taxonomy if it adds signal — mission-XX auto-labels, type-prefix auto-labels, etc. Can be added in v1.1 if PR-volume growth justifies.`

---

## Option C (Director override) — escape hatch

Named explicitly so operators know when it's appropriate vs when it's a shortcut.

### Criteria — Director-override IS appropriate when

- **Prod-outage response** requires immediate main-branch fix (bypass queue; fix lands; post-mortem PR reconstructs review within 48h)
- **Queue infrastructure failure** — merge queue itself broken (fallback: direct-push by Director only, pending infrastructure repair)
- **Methodology bootstrap** — the first use of a new workflow methodology may itself require override (the doc doesn't yet enforce itself)
- **Sovereign-branch mission completion** — missions started before trunk-migration may complete on old workflow (see §Migration, below)

### Director-override is NOT appropriate when

- "We didn't want to follow the process" (use the process)
- "The CODEOWNERS check blocked us" (get the CODEOWNER's review)
- "We were in a hurry" (PR workflow adds ~10 minutes, not days)
- Recurring bypass pattern (if Option C becomes frequent, re-author the methodology)

### Director-override commit format

- `[override]` prefix in commit subject
- `Reason: <rationale>` in commit body
- `Post-mortem: <link-to-thread-or-TBD>` reference
- Post-mortem thread within 48 hours of the override

---

## Migration from sovereign-branch-per-agent (ADR-023 phase map)

Four-phase migration per ADR-023:

- **Phase 1** — Infrastructure ship (mission-45). CODEOWNERS + branch protection + merge queue + secret-scan + pre-commit + this doc + env-setup doc. **Phase 1 executes on the old sovereign-branch workflow** (bootstrap paradox — the new workflow isn't in effect yet when the scaffolding ships).
- **Phase 2** — First validator mission on new workflow (mission-43). Real-use test of the scaffolding.
- **Phase 3** — Formal deprecation of sovereign-branch. Add Superseded header to `multi-branch-merge.md` (landed as part of mission-45 T6b). This doc becomes sole source of truth.
- **Phase 4** — Scale-out to N>2 agents. Zero-cost under new workflow; scaffolding handles it.

### Missions started pre-migration

If a mission was mid-flight when the migration landed:
- **Finish on the old workflow** if it's within one mission-close of complete (don't re-start the work)
- **Re-route to new workflow** if it's multi-week + multi-task; cut a new branch from current main; re-base as PRs

---

## Failure modes + recovery

### PR stuck waiting for review

- First: confirm reviewer has been notified via Hub thread (Option A MVP) and hasn't responded
- Second: thread-ping the reviewer with explicit escalation cue (`decision_needed` intent)
- Third: if still stuck >2 working days, Director ratifies via PR comment (not Option C override — just direct escalation)

### Merge conflict with main during queue

- Queue auto-rebases; if rebase fails, PR returns to author
- Author resolves conflict locally, force-pushes-with-lease to the PR branch
- Re-notifies reviewer on thread if conflict resolution changed scope meaningfully
- Re-queues

### CI regression on main (post-land)

- Revert PR immediately (fresh `[fix]` or `[revert]` PR; same workflow)
- File a bug
- Follow-up fix PR addresses root cause
- Never `git push --force` to main (even post-revert, use a revert-commit)

### CODEOWNERS gate-failure (no primary owner available)

- If the CODEOWNER is offline/disconnected for >1 working day, escalate to Director via thread
- Director can add themselves as temporary reviewer for critical PRs
- Don't try to reassign CODEOWNERS mid-PR; amend CODEOWNERS in a separate PR

`TODO(engineer): what happens when an agent leaves the pool permanently and their directory-ownership lapses — process for re-assigning CODEOWNERS?`

---

## Anti-patterns (do not do)

- **Direct push to main** — blocked by branch protection; if you find yourself wanting to, ask why; if legitimate, Option C with post-mortem
- **Rubber-stamp approvals on shared-surface files** — shared-surface review requires engagement
- **Stacked PRs without declaring the dependency** — if PR-B depends on PR-A, say so in PR-B's body + target PR-B at PR-A's branch, not main (until PR-A lands)
- **Bypass husky with `--no-verify` without explanation** — bypass is permitted; silent bypass is not
- **Merge own PR** — queue enforces; don't try to work around CODEOWNERS
- **Landing a PR that doesn't match its stated scope** — PRs should do what they say; scope creep → split into multiple PRs
- **Force-push to main** — ever (see §Recovery §CI regression)
- **Long-lived PR branches** — branches should live ~hours to ~2 days; longer means the PR is too big (split it)

---

## Relationship to other methodology documents

- **`strategic-review.md`** — triages backlog + ratifies mission priorities; operates pre-mission-activation
- **`mission-preflight.md`** — activation gate between proposed → active; per-mission audit
- **This doc** — per-PR integration gate; operates continuously through a mission's active phase, not only at mission-close
- **`multi-branch-merge.md` (Superseded)** — historical reference for the sovereign-branch-per-agent model; see its header for the Superseded-by pointer

Together, these cover the full mission lifecycle — backlog triage → mission activation → per-PR integration → mission close — on the new workflow.

---

## Methodology evolution

Treat as engineered component — version, critique, evolve.

### v1.0 → v1.1 pending deltas

To be captured post-mission-43 (the first worked example on new workflow):
- Any unanticipated review-cadence friction
- Any CODEOWNERS gap or false-trigger
- Any merge-queue behavior that surprised
- Option A → Option B transition signal (when does thread-notification friction hit the threshold?)

### Retrospective cadence

Follow the retrospective-lite pattern from `strategic-review.md` §Retrospective-of-the-Review:
- **Retrospective-lite** (same-PR-session, optional): methodology deltas while context is fresh
- **Formal retrospective** (mission-outcome-triggered): fold into this doc's next version

First retrospective expected after mission-43 close.

---

## Success criteria for a PR

A PR is successful if:

1. All CI gates pass (test + secret-scan + any others)
2. CODEOWNERS approvals acquired (primary + shared-surface if applicable)
3. Merge queue land is clean (no rebase conflicts surfaced)
4. Post-land CI on main stays green
5. Hub-state updated to reflect landed work (task transition, review creation, etc.)
6. Branch cleanup complete (local + remote)
7. Any scope-drift or follow-up items filed as ideas / bugs, not dropped

A PR review is successful if:

1. Review left within review-cadence SLA (1 working day non-urgent)
2. Explicit position stated (`--approve` or `--request-changes`)
3. Shared-surface review engages with cross-system implications, not just the diff
4. Request-changes items are actionable (author knows what to change)

---

## Engineer co-authorship pending

Sections marked `TODO(engineer)`:
- §Step 1a branch creation (exact git command sequence, stacked-branch handling)
- §Step 2a push command (including force-push-with-lease policy)
- §Step 4 merge-queue strategy (squash vs merge default)
- §Step 4 merge-queue failure recovery
- §Step 5c Hub-state transition sequence post-PR-land
- §Review discipline stale-PR nudge cadence
- §PR artifact conventions label taxonomy (optional v1.1)
- §Failure modes CODEOWNERS-gap escalation

These are execution-heavy; engineer field-ownership applies. Engineer co-author picks these up after T1–T5 land (or in parallel if capacity permits).

---
