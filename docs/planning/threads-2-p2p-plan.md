# Threads 2.0 — direct P2P plan (Mission-21 Phase 1 follow-on)

**Status:** working document — mutable, not an ADR or spec. Promote or delete when complete.
**Owner:** Director · **Started:** 2026-04-18

## Goal

Direct, private, autonomous peer-to-peer threads between any pairs of roles. Concretely: two local Claude Code engineers (or an architect and an engineer, or future architect↔architect) open a thread with each other, converge on an outcome, and optionally spawn entities — without any third agent observing the conversation or participating in convergence.

## Current state (2026-04-18)

Commits landed on `main`:
- `4cb52e7` — M21 Phase 1 core (staged actions, summary, participants, gate)
- `9d951f5` — M21 Phase 1 hardening: architect prompt + digest wiring
- `f2f3799` — M21 Phase 1 hardening: tool-driven thread replies + cascade guard
- `fc7f8d3` — M21 Phase 1 hardening: participant-scoped routing + 3-agent smoke

Shipped invariants (pragmatic — awaiting Architect ratification into spec):
- **INV-TH16** — thread dispatches (open, reply, converged, convergence_completed) scoped to `participants[]` via `Selector.engineerIds`; fallback to role only when no participants have resolved agentIds.
- **INV-TH17** — reply turn pinned to `currentTurnAgentId` in addition to role; a reply whose `authorAgentId` doesn't match is rejected.

New schema surface (awaiting Architect ratification):
- `Selector.engineerIds?: string[]` (pool filter)
- `Thread.recipientAgentId?: string | null` (opener-declared counterparty)
- `Thread.currentTurnAgentId?: string | null` (per-turn pin)
- `OpenThreadOptions` bag (replaces positional args on `openThread`)
- `create_thread` tool gained `recipientAgentId` optional arg

Test coverage:
- Hub 299 + network-adapter 84 passing
- `packages/network-adapter/test/integration/threads-2-smoke.test.ts` — 11 scenarios, 3-agent harness (arch, eng-1, eng-2) on `PolicyLoopbackHub` + `LoopbackTransport`

Production state:
- Hub revision `hub-00008-8tx` (2026-04-18) — INV-TH16/17 live; `recipientAgentId` advertised on `create_thread`.
- Architect revision `architect-agent-00023-7s5` — tool-driven reply, cascade guard, 60s director-chat TTL. OK as-is.

## Plan — tiered

### Tier 1 — live P2P enablement (one mission, executing now)

| # | Item | Status | Architect review? |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | Deploy hardened Hub (INV-TH16/17) | [x] `hub-00008-8tx` live 2026-04-18 | No — mechanical |
| T2 | Engineer-plugin Threads 2.0 instructions (AGENTS.md + prompt-format) | [x] Shipped — see `packages/network-adapter/src/prompt-format.ts` and `adapters/opencode-plugin/AGENTS.md` Ideation Threads section | Not blocking — flag for comment in review thread |
| T3 | Discovery tool — extend `get_engineer_status` to expose agentId + labels (vs new `list_peers`) | [ ] held | **Yes** — new public tool surface. Hold pending Architect thread. |
| T4 | ITW smoke: two Claude Code engineers vs prod Hub, close_no_action convergence | [x] PASS on `thread-122` (2026-04-18T07:24Z). greg (`eng-0d2c690e7dd5`) ↔ kate (`eng-2c249473aa50`) bilateral convergence; architect received zero events for the thread (0 architect audit entries); INV-TH16 + INV-TH17 validated live. | No — pure validation |

Shipping T1 + T2 + T4 unilaterally. T3 held until Architect thread completes.

### Tier 2 — autonomous production throughput (parallel)

**M-Phase2 — full convergence vocabulary**
- [ ] Zod `stagedActions.type` widened: `create_task | create_proposal | create_idea | create_mission | update_mission | update_idea` (6 types)
- [ ] Cascade handlers per type, best-effort with `ConvergenceReport.warning` on partial failure
- [ ] Idempotency keys per action (natural key: action-id + thread-id)
- [ ] Back-link on spawned entity: `sourceThreadId` + `sourceActionId`
- [ ] Un-skip and rewrite 10 Phase 2 tests in `wave3b-policies.test.ts` / `e2e-convergence-spawn.test.ts`
- [ ] Extend 3-agent smoke with create_task + create_proposal convergence

**M-SandwichTests — unit-test harness for sandwich handlers**
- [ ] Mock `HubAdapter` + `ContextStore`
- [ ] Regression tests for `sandwichThreadReply` tool-driven contract (allow-list, cascade suppression, gate self-correction)
- [ ] Coverage for all five sandwiches (thread reply, thread converged, review report, review proposal, clarification)

### Tier 3 — polish (later)

**M-Phase3 — Path B removal + observability**
- [ ] Delete legacy single-convergenceAction code path
- [ ] Metrics: gate-rejection counter by reason; per-action-type exec success/fail; participant-count + round-at-convergence histograms
- [ ] Wire into Director digest (`thread_convergence_completed` data or time-series sink)

## Architect review gate

**When:** after Tier 1 ships (Hub deployed, engineer instructions updated, ITW smoke passed).

**Thread scope:**

1. **Retrospective ratification** (already shipped)
   - INV-TH16 participant-scoped routing — is this the right invariant name/shape?
   - INV-TH17 agent-pinned turn — same
   - Amendments needed in `docs/specs/workflow-registry.md` §1.3 thread FSM
   - ADR-013 amendment or new ADR covering INV-TH16/17

2. **Forward design — T3 discovery tool**
   - Extend `get_engineer_status` (one tool does more) vs new `list_peers(role?, labels?)` (clearer naming)
   - Return shape: `{agentId, role, labels, status, lastSeenAt}` — what else?
   - Visibility: broadcast all online agents? Scope by caller's labels? Require opt-in?
   - Privacy: the Director's view vs peer view

2b. **Forward design — `close_thread` role guard** (new, surfaced by thread-123 smoke)
   - Where is the `[Architect]` tool-description tag enforced? Hub policy handler has no role check, so the guard lives higher (plugin proxy layer, per the `Authorization denied` error text)
   - Should participants of an engineer↔engineer thread be allowed to unilaterally close it? Today only bilateral `close_no_action` convergence or an architect close works
   - If we keep the guard: document the expected pattern (participants always converge, never unilateral close) and tighten `close_thread` description accordingly
   - If we relax it: allow any participant to close; keep architect as an override for stuck/abandoned threads

3. **Forward design — M-Phase2 action vocabulary**
   - 6 action types — agreed set?
   - Cascade semantics: best-effort with warning (partial success OK) vs all-or-nothing (rollback on any failure)?
   - Idempotency strategy
   - Back-linking — should entities carry just `sourceThreadId` or full `sourceActionId` too?
   - Director involvement: does a Phase 2 `create_mission` action require Director approval, or is Architect+Engineer agreement sufficient?

## Held / out of scope

- **Director-role participation in threads** — currently "reserved". Worth a design thread later; not urgent.
- **agentId ↔ engineerId naming unification** — idea-85; blocked on Entity SSOT mission (hub-mission-22).

## Working log

- 2026-04-18 — Doc created. Tier 1 starting.
- 2026-04-18 — T1 deployed (`hub-00008-8tx`); `recipientAgentId` live on `create_thread`. T2 landed: `prompt-format.ts` dropped hard-coded "[Architect]" prefix (now role-aware) and embeds Threads 2.0 gate discipline in the per-notification prompt; `adapters/opencode-plugin/AGENTS.md` Ideation Threads section rewritten for Threads 2.0 (stagedActions, summary, gate, recipientAgentId, peer discovery). T4 two-engineer smoke pending Director-run pair test.
- 2026-04-18 — OIS_INSTANCE_ID env override (`26ed0f8`) + start-claude.sh name argument (`dd90882`) shipped to unblock multi-agent co-location on one laptop. T4 two-engineer smoke PASSED: thread-122, greg (`eng-0d2c690e7dd5`) ↔ kate (`eng-2c249473aa50`), architect silent (0 audit entries), action-1 committed, cascade fired cleanly. INV-TH16 + INV-TH17 validated live on prod.
- 2026-04-18 — Extended T4 with an autonomous-loop chain test (thread-123 + thread-124). Kate's Claude Code loop parsed a two-step ask (unilateral close + open new thread back), attempted both actions, faithfully reported the failing step in the new thread's opening message, and then autonomously chained cleanup work across both threads to reach bilateral convergence. Strongest live evidence so far of genuine autonomous peer-engineer behaviour. Three P2P threads (122/123/124) all closed with zero architect audit entries.
- 2026-04-18 — Finding surfaced for the Architect review thread: `close_thread` is role-guarded at the plugin/proxy layer with an explicit `"Authorization denied: tool 'close_thread' requires role 'architect', but caller is 'engineer'"`. The `[Architect]` prefix in tool descriptions is enforced, not advisory. Hub policy handler has no role check — guard lives higher. Worth pinning down where and deciding whether to relax for participant-initiated close on engineer↔engineer threads where no architect is a participant.
