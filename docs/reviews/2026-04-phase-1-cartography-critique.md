# Phase 1 Cartography — Architect's Tele-Alignment Critique (Pass 1)

**Status:** DRAFT — engineer-apply-ready; awaits Director ratification
**Author:** lily (architect, eng-40903c59d19f), 2026-04-22 AEST
**Responds to:** `docs/reviews/2026-04-phase-1-cartography.md` (engineer Pass 1, commit `6721ba3` on agent/greg)
**Source:** thread-248 (correlationId `2026-04-architectural-review`)
**Plan reference:** `docs/reviews/2026-04-architectural-review.md` §Phase 1

## 0. Scope confirmation (answers to greg's Q1 + Q3)

**Q1 — Tele-rewrite remap authority.** Confirmed: the architect owns the canonical remap. This doc provides it. Engineer deferral in Pass 1 §4.1 option (b) was the right call — heuristic remap by the drafter would have anchored my read. Pass 1's explicit ambiguity register (§0 caveat + per-cluster `(b) LIKELY MISALIGNED` callouts) is the correct shape of deferral.

**Q3 — Reverse-gap flag bar.** Confirmed: "zero forward-motion ideas attributable in the new numbering" is the right bar. tele-0 (umbrella) is definitionally empty, not a reverse-gap. tele-8 is the only genuine reverse-gap after my remap — see §4.

Out-of-scope noted per Director feedback: mission-numbering chaos (Pass 1 §4.2), Phase-2x measurement-thread reaping (§4.5). Both flagged for post-review hardening; not this Phase 1 concern.

## 1. Authoritative old→new tele remap

Derived from `docs/specs/teles.md` §Provenance. Pre-reset had 9 teles numbered 1–9. Post-reset has 11 teles numbered 0–10. The mapping:

| Old tele (pre-reset) | Old name | New tele | New name | Fidelity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | (persistence, narrow) | **1** | Sovereign State Transparency | evolved-broader (absorbs AX-010 State Sovereignty) |
| 2 | Frictionless Agentic Collaboration | **6** | Frictionless Agentic Collaboration | name preserved; ID changed |
| 3 | (workflow/FSM aspect) | **2** | Isomorphic Specification | merged (FSM aspect of old tele-3 absorbed by new tele-2) |
| 4 | Resilient Agentic Operations | **7** | Resilient Agentic Operations | name preserved; ID changed |
| 5 | (Declarative Primacy) | **2** | Isomorphic Specification | merged (absorbs AX-050 Declarative Primacy) |
| 6 | Deterministic Invincibility | **9** | Chaos-Validated Deployment | chaos-aspect only; layered aspect dropped |
| 7 | Perfect Contextual Hydration | **5** | Perceptual Parity | evolved-broader (absorbs AX-040 Observability Symmetry) |
| 8 | Autopoietic Evolution | **10** | Autopoietic Evolution | name preserved; ID changed |
| 9 | (umbrella) | **0** | Sovereign Intelligence Engine | renamed + repositioned as umbrella |

**New teles with no pre-reset predecessor** (ideas must be placed by body, not remapped):
- **tele-3** Sovereign Composition (from idea-148 + AX-020 Interface Singularity)
- **tele-4** Zero-Loss Knowledge (from AX-030 Knowledge Fidelity)
- **tele-8** Gated Recursive Integrity (from AX-060 Recursive Integrity, layered-construction aspect only)

**Correction to greg's Pass 1 §0 table:** greg's table lists "(none) → new tele-3" (correct), "(none) → new tele-4" (correct), "(none) → new tele-8" (correct). But in §2 greg's "old tele-9 was Determinism" prose is incorrect — old tele-9 was the umbrella per the spec, not Determinism. Pre-reset tele-6 was "Deterministic Invincibility" (split to new tele-8 + tele-9).

## 2. Ideas with `audit:tele_primary=tele-N` — authoritative remap

### 2.1 Mechanical remap (unambiguous by spec map)

Apply these tag-flips directly during revision. Format: `idea-X: old tele-N → new tele-M` (with secondary tele where supported by idea body / audit tags).

**old tele-1 → new tele-1** (scope broadened; stays):
- idea-39 → **new tele-1** primary
- idea-97 → **new tele-1** primary (ADR-017 comms-reliability + durability)

**old tele-2 → new tele-6** (Frictionless):
- idea-20 → **new tele-6** primary; tele-3 secondary (auto-linkage is a composition concern)
- idea-25 → **new tele-6** primary; tele-2 secondary (Routine as Isomorphic spec consumer)
- idea-30 → **new tele-2** primary, tele-6 secondary (task-FSM workflow-registry is pure Isomorphic)
- idea-50 → **new tele-3** primary (tx/rx dedup is composition), tele-6 secondary
- idea-68 → **new tele-6** primary (update_task lifecycle friction)
- idea-73 → **new tele-6** primary (generalized routing = zero-friction multi-agent)
- idea-79 → **new tele-3** primary (JSON-schema architecture = composition layer)
- idea-90 → **new tele-2** primary (Threads 2.0 anycast spec)
- idea-91 → **new tele-2** primary (multicast dynamic-membership spec)
- idea-92 → **new tele-2** primary (multicast open-dispatch spec)

**old tele-3 → new tele-2** (FSM merged) OR **new tele-3** (if body is about modularity):
- idea-24 → **new tele-2** primary (role/RBAC workflow-registry = Isomorphic)
- idea-46 → **new tele-1** primary (M18 advisory-tags observability); tele-3 secondary
- idea-60 → **new tele-1** primary (structured telemetry observability)
- idea-63 → **new tele-1** primary (agent session-table observability)
- idea-94 → **new tele-7** primary (cascade replay-queue resilience); tele-3 secondary
- idea-95 → **new tele-3** primary (cross-action deps = composition); tele-7 secondary
- idea-103 → **new tele-3** primary (Zod-strict is contract purity)

**old tele-4 → new tele-7** (Resilient):
- idea-6 → **new tele-7** primary (task reassign/timeout)
- idea-15 → **new tele-7** primary (architect session-management resilience)
- idea-18 → **new tele-7** primary (SDK performance/tech-debt in resilience layer)
- idea-33 → **new tele-7** primary (state-machine auto-triage)
- idea-54 → **new tele-7** primary (architect-chat resilience)
- idea-55 → **new tele-9** primary (Terraform IaC = deployment = Chaos-Validated); tele-7 secondary
- idea-74 → **new tele-9** primary (terraform env-isolation = deployment)
- idea-78 → **new tele-6** primary (admin force-close = operator affordance); tele-7 secondary
- idea-93 → **new tele-7** primary (deferred-queue hardening)
- idea-96 → **new tele-7** primary (cascade-failed recovery)
- idea-98 → **new tele-7** primary (routing-modes hardening)
- idea-99 → **new tele-7** primary (dispatch hardening)
- idea-105 → **new tele-7** primary (watchdog SLA tuning)
- idea-106 → **new tele-7** primary (Agent.status deprecation + wakeEndpoint)

**old tele-5 → new tele-2** (Isomorphic):
- idea-48 → **new tele-3** primary (tx/rx dedup network-adapter = composition); tele-2 secondary
- idea-66 → **new tele-2** primary (wire-level event-schema renaming)
- idea-69 → **new tele-2** primary (tool-surface MCP standardization)
- idea-80 → **new tele-4** primary (tags-vs-labels metadata clarity = Knowledge Fidelity); tele-2 secondary
- idea-81 → **new tele-4** primary (correlation-id typed-refs = Knowledge Fidelity)
- idea-82 → **new tele-3** primary (BaseEntity turnId refactor = composition); tele-2 secondary
- idea-83 → **new tele-4** primary (status-vs-state terminology)
- idea-85 → **new tele-4** primary (naming-standardization cleanup)
- idea-102 → **new tele-3** primary (Universal Port = composition layer); tele-2 secondary

**old tele-7 → new tele-5** (Perceptual Parity):
- idea-11 → **new tele-4** primary (Wisdom/Context Management = Knowledge Fidelity); tele-5 secondary
- idea-13 → **new tele-5** primary (code-visibility tooling = parity)
- idea-35 → **new tele-5** primary (architect-prompt hardening = hydration)
- idea-45 → **new tele-5** primary (tooling observability DX)
- idea-56 → **new tele-5** primary (thread-guidance system-prompt)
- idea-58 → **new tele-5** primary (plugin notifications)
- idea-61 → **new tele-5** primary (architect-chat ACP/TUI)
- idea-64 → **new tele-4** primary (lightweight note entity = Knowledge); tele-5 secondary
- idea-65 → **new tele-4** primary (beacon entity = research knowledge)
- idea-70 → **new tele-5** primary (list-filter ergonomics)
- idea-72 → **new tele-5** primary (on-demand context retrieval = hydration)

**old tele-8 → new tele-10** (Autopoietic):
- idea-14 → **new tele-10** primary (auto-triage resilience)

**old tele-9 ideas (greg's "new tele-9 cluster (b) audit signal")** — per spec, old tele-9 was the umbrella → new tele-0. But umbrella-placement is usually wrong; individual body read required:
- idea-5 → **new tele-5** primary (frontend UX ag-ui = Perceptual Parity); tele-6 secondary
- idea-23 → **new tele-9** primary (CI/GitHub = Chaos-Validated Deployment)
- idea-27 → **new tele-2** primary (workflow-registry kubernetes-analogy = Isomorphic)
- idea-43 → **new tele-3** primary (capability/network-expansion = composition)
- idea-62 → **new tele-5** primary (architect-chat external UI = Perceptual Parity)
- idea-67 → **new tele-6** primary (identity/GitHub attribution = frictionless collaboration)
- idea-71 → **new tele-3** primary (gemini-cli adapter = composition); tele-6 secondary
- idea-84 → **new tele-3** primary (cognitive-architecture network-adapter = composition); tele-5 secondary
- idea-86 → **new tele-5** primary (director integration = Perceptual Parity)

### 2.2 Net effect of remap

After applying §2.1, greg's Pass 1 per-tele cluster sizes become:

| Tele | Pass 1 size | Post-remap size | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| tele-0 | 0 | 0 | unchanged (umbrella, expected empty) |
| tele-1 | 4 | ~8 | +4 (absorbed old tele-3 observability ideas) |
| tele-2 | 19 | ~12 | -7 (frictionless ideas moved to tele-6; gained from old tele-5 Isomorphic + FSM-aspect ideas) |
| tele-3 | 11 | ~18 | +7 (absorbed composition ideas from old tele-2/5/9) |
| tele-4 | 16 | ~10 | -6 (Resilient ideas moved to tele-7; absorbed Knowledge Fidelity from old tele-5) |
| tele-5 | 11 | ~14 | +3 (absorbed Hydration ideas from old tele-7 + tele-9) |
| tele-6 | 3 | ~11 | +8 (absorbed Frictionless from old tele-2 + operator affordances) |
| tele-7 | 13 | ~20 | +7 (absorbed Resilient from old tele-4 + cascade replay-queue) |
| tele-8 | 0 | **0** | **unchanged — REVERSE-GAP confirmed** |
| tele-9 | 16 | ~6 | -10 (most "new tele-9" ideas were old tele-9 umbrella; only idea-23/55/74 are actual CI/Chaos/Deployment) |
| tele-10 | 4 | ~5 | +1 (from old tele-8 Autopoietic) |

Totals: ~104 ideas placed; 33 orphans to place in §3; ~18 ideas still in `dismissed` status (not clustered per scope).

---

## 3. Orphan placement (33 ideas)

### 3.1 Dismiss — bug-migration legacy (9 ideas)

Confirmed: original "bug" Ideas migrated to first-class Bug entities; scope now lives in linked Bug record. Dismiss all 9 (they carry `migrated-to-bug-N` tags explicitly):

- idea-19 → DISMISS (→ bug-1)
- idea-22 → DISMISS (→ bug-2)
- idea-28 → DISMISS (→ bug-3)
- idea-29 → DISMISS (→ bug-4)
- idea-40 → DISMISS (→ bug-5)
- idea-41 → DISMISS (→ bug-6)
- idea-57 → DISMISS (→ bug-7)
- idea-88 → DISMISS (→ bug-8)
- idea-89 → DISMISS (→ bug-9)

Use `audit:valid=superseded-by-bug` + status flip. Greg can batch these with a single status update per idea.

### 3.2 Place (24 ideas)

Derived from idea tags + title patterns. `P=primary`, `S=secondary`.

**Ideas 115–128 (M-Cognitive-Hypervisor / vocabulary / strategic cluster):**
- idea-115 (dynamic-tool-scope) → **P tele-3** (composition), **S tele-5** (perceptual parity — scoped tool surface reduces hallucinated-surface noise)
- idea-117 (retry-death-spiral queue) → **P tele-7** (resilient ops)
- idea-118 (circuit-breaker queue) → **P tele-7**
- idea-119 (query-shape-engineering tool-surface) → **P tele-5** (prompt-side hydration), **S tele-2** (isomorphic query surface)
- idea-122 (`reset_agent` operator affordance) → **P tele-6** (frictionless operator action), **S tele-7** (state recovery)
- idea-123 (thread-reply protocol simplification) → **P tele-2** (isomorphic protocol)
- idea-124 (label-routing / reserved-labels / VRF) → **P tele-2** (routing-layer isomorphism), **S tele-6**
- idea-125 (clarification primitives ADR-017) → **P tele-2** (protocol primitives), **S tele-6**
- idea-126 (Kubernetes entity-model long-term strategic) → **P tele-2** (k8s-style CRD is the ratified direction)
- idea-127 (threads-2.0 semantic-intent mechanism) → **P tele-2** (mechanism-design), **S tele-6**
- idea-128 (gitops multi-agent concurrent-engineers) → **P tele-9** (deployment / coordination), **S tele-6**

**Ideas 129–143 (vocabulary chain cluster):**
- idea-129 (Design entity) → **P tele-2** (Manifest/Isomorphic), **S tele-4** (knowledge fidelity)
- idea-130 (Manifest entity) → **P tele-2** (explicitly "Manifest is the Master"), **S tele-3**
- idea-131 (Registry entity) → **P tele-1** (state transparency), **S tele-5** (discoverability)
- idea-132 (triaged; incorporated into mission-38) → **P tele-7** (cognitive-layer resilience). Retain open status or reclass `incorporated`? Engineer call during revision.
- idea-133 (Concept entity) → **P tele-4** (Zero-Loss Knowledge — concepts ARE the knowledge vocabulary), **S tele-10** (autopoietic — concepts feed self-refinement)
- idea-134 (Trace + Report entity) → **P tele-4** (bit-perfect fidelity of execution history), **S tele-10**
- idea-135 (Survey entity) → **P tele-4** (structured input), **S tele-6** (pre-brainstorm frictionless)
- idea-136 (Routine entity) → **P tele-2** (scheduled governance = spec-driven), **S tele-10** (autopoietic maintenance)
- idea-137 (Evaluation framework) → **P tele-10** (autopoietic — evaluation feeds refinement), **S tele-4**
- idea-138 (Cost-aware tier routing) → **P tele-6** (economic optimization of collaboration), **S tele-7**
- idea-139 (Goal entity) → **P tele-4** (project-scope knowledge), **S tele-2** (goal-tele bridge)
- idea-140–143 (concept-candidates harvested from 139) → **P tele-4** (vocabulary expansion), **S tele-10**. These are concept seeds; batch the same assignment.

**Ideas 144–155 (post-mission-40 follow-ups + strategic target-state):**
- idea-144 (workflow engine review→next-task advancement) → **P tele-6** (frictionless mission advancement), **S tele-2** (Hub workflow primitives)
- idea-145 (chunked-reply v2) → **P tele-7** (resilience follow-up)
- idea-146 (continuation v2) → **P tele-7**
- idea-147 (Rule entity — project policy layer) → **P tele-2** (explicit policy = isomorphic spec), **S tele-4**
- idea-148 (Sovereign Composition source idea, landed as tele-3) → **P tele-3** (this IS the tele-3 origin artifact)
- idea-149 (tele audit ratification artifact) → **P tele-4** (this IS the Zero-Loss Knowledge artifact applied to the constitutional layer), **S tele-10** (autopoietic constitutional refinement)
- idea-150 (Environment Deployer CI/CD GCP) → **P tele-9** (deployment), **S tele-6**
- idea-151 (Graph relationships registry) → **P tele-1** (structured state topology), **S tele-4** (knowledge graph)
- idea-152 (Smart NIC Adapter target-state) → **P tele-3** (composition layer replacing adapter + transport), **S tele-1** (state transparency); also tele-7 tertiary
- idea-153 (adapter-core refactor) → **P tele-3** (composition)
- idea-154 (wrapper-script `OIS_EAGER_SESSION_CLAIM` durable surface) → **P tele-1** (observable deployment state), **S tele-7** (operator onboarding)
- idea-155 (AuditEntry typed payload) → **P tele-1** (structured state fidelity), **S tele-4** (knowledge integrity)

## 4. Reverse-gap confirmation + seed proposals

### 4.1 tele-0 (Sovereign Intelligence Engine umbrella)

**Not a reverse-gap.** Umbrella by definition; composition of tele-1..tele-10 IS forward-motion toward tele-0. No direct ideas expected. Mark in cartography as "umbrella — aggregates below".

### 4.2 tele-8 (Gated Recursive Integrity)

**Confirmed reverse-gap.** After full remap + orphan placement, zero forward-motion ideas attributable. The tele's Mandate (layered integrity, binary pass/fail gates, no partial-credit ascension) has no champion in the current backlog.

**Proposed seed ideas (Phase 4 mission-candidate territory, flagged here for reverse-gap closure):**

1. **Layer-certification registry.** Formal enumeration of architectural layers (L0 Hub protocol / L1 entity-registry / L2 policy-router / L3 threads+cascade / L4 cognitive-layer / L5 adapter) with per-layer pass/fail gate + known-good commit. Closes the "Foundation-of-Sand" fault; makes the "Law of Fallback" actionable.
2. **Binary certification for Phase-2d CP3 reaper+lifecycle.** Existing work toward it; naming it as tele-8-aligned makes the gate explicit.
3. **Merge-gate automation: no Layer N+1 change without Layer N green.** Codify as CI policy + review checklist.

These aren't mission briefs yet — just seed ideas so tele-8 has ≥1 attributed forward-motion item before Phase 4 prioritization. Engineer should file as Ideas during revision (3 separate, or 1 umbrella). Filing them in my name (architect-authored) is the cleanest provenance.

### 4.3 Other teles

All others populated after remap. tele-4 (Zero-Loss Knowledge) absorbs the largest pull from vocabulary-chain orphans — consistent with the ratified direction.

---

## 5. Built / Ratified-but-unshipped / Open split (deeper)

Extension of greg's §4.4 sketch. Evidence in parentheses; missions + commits cited where applicable.

### 5.1 BUILT (in-prod, tests green, deployed)

| Direction | Evidence | Bugs/gaps |
|---|---|---|
| Threads 2.0 (ADR-013/014) | mission-22, mission-23, mission-24 shipped; Phase 2 cascade runner landed | bug-23 (bilateral-seal race, minor) |
| ADR-017 comms-reliability (queue + persist-first) | `074b6c1`..`316baa8` + follow-ups; mission-30 ran against it | bug-11 (cognitive-layer silence; distinct scope), bug-22 (continuation retry), bug-12 (test-helper drift) |
| Identity layer (Mission-18 + Mission-19 + bug-16 reaper + mission-40 identity/session split) | mission-40 closed 2026-04-22 (commits `18cde2d`..`e2ce3f8`); bug-16 resolved (`9385290`, `6eacfca`); bug-26 resolved | Zero open identity-layer bugs at severity≥major |
| Cognitive Layer Phase 1 (ADR-018 / `@ois/cognitive-layer` package) | Phase 1 ckpt 1–4 landed; `ToolResultCache` + `FlushAllOnWriteStrategy` shipping | mission-31/32/33/34 duplicates as design-entity artifacts only |
| Cognitive Hypervisor adapter mitigations (mission-38) | Completed 2026-04-21, 5-task scope + closing audit | bug-11 verdict pending 24–48h observability window |
| Mission-19 Granular Routing (label-selector routing) | mission-18 entity = "Mission-19 Granular Routing" (7 tasks shipped) | none known |
| Tele rewrite (idea-149 ratification) | 11 teles in GCS at tele-0..tele-10; spec at `docs/specs/teles.md` | bug-24 blocks retirement of 5 legacy tele records (additive overwrite was the workaround) |
| Workflow-registry v2.0 | Multiple FSM tables + INV-TH# invariants; shipped across multiple missions | Partial (some FSMs still documented-only; entity-registry §5 Wall-of-Shame enumerates) |
| M-Cascade-Perfection Phase 1 + 2 | mission-29 + Phase 2d CP1/CP2/CP3 shipped | CP4 (`retry_cascade`) deferred; bug-14/15/bug-27 minor cascade drift |

### 5.2 RATIFIED-but-unshipped (Director-approved direction; code not yet in-prod)

| Direction | Status | Gating |
|---|---|---|
| Vocabulary chain (Concept→Idea→Design→Manifest→Mission→Trace→Report) | Ratified 2026-04-21; ideas 129–143 filed | No entity implementation started; no mission brief; Phase 4 candidate |
| Goal entity (idea-139) | Ratified scope 2026-04-21 | Filing as Hub primitive pending |
| k8s-style API as target tool-surface (review input §14.1) | Ratified direction per review plan §"Ratified directions" | Post-review mission scope (anti-goal §1); idea-121 + idea-126 carry candidate spec |
| Mission-19 P2P agentId targeting (in-Mission-19 scope, deferred sub-scope) | Ratified but implementation pending | Mission-19's task-197 range |
| Multi-engineer concurrent REPO work protocol | Identified problem per review plan §Ratified-directions item 6 | Candidate mission output, not review work |
| Deprecation of mission-40's back-compat auto-claim paths (brief §10.1) | Gated on deprecation-runway dashboard zero-trend | Post-architectural-review hardening |
| `AuditEntry` typed payload (idea-155) | Filed post-mission-40 | Gated on dashboard-consumer maturity |

### 5.3 OPEN (not yet ratified direction OR target-state architecture)

| Direction | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Smart NIC Adapter (idea-152) | Open target-state | Absorbs identity + transport; would supersede idea-153 (adapter-core) |
| Rule entity (idea-147) | Open | Project-level policy/convention layer; awaits triage |
| Graph relationships registry (idea-151) | Open | Hub primitive for idea-dependency graphs |
| Environment Deployer (idea-150) | Open | CI/CD GCP deployer tooling |
| Universal Port (idea-102) | Open | Supersedes idea-17 (dismissed) |
| Adapter-core extraction (idea-153) | Open | Transitional vs idea-152 target-state; explicitly noted as superseded-by-idea-152 in its body |
| Director-chat redesign | Pending architect-adapter redesign (my memory refs this) | No mission yet |
| Wrapper-script tracking (idea-154) | Open post-mission-40 | Small cleanup; hub-config.json candidate |

---

## 6. Answers to greg's Q2 + Q4 + Q5 (Director-directed)

**Q2 — Mission-numbering cleanup:** Out of Phase 1 scope. File as post-review hardening item after Phase 4 closes. Not an anti-goal exception (review didn't introduce it — it's pre-existing churn).

**Q4 — Phase 2x measurement-thread reaping (16 stuck threads):** Defer to post-hardening. Sweeping mid-review violates review anti-goal §6 ("no opportunistic mid-review missions"). Flag in the cartography artifact's §4.5 as-is; Phase 4 can include a candidate "thread-reaper operational audit" mission brief if cleanup scope warrants.

**Q5 — Pass 1 sufficiency:** Pass 1 shape is good; do NOT attempt heuristic remap before architect critique (which is THIS). Pass 1 correctly handed the remap to me.

---

## 7. Summary for engineer revision

What greg applies in the Pass 1 → Pass 1.1 revision:

1. **Apply §2.1 tag-flips**: batch `update_idea` calls to replace `audit:tele_primary=tele-N` with new-numbering assignments per the table. Preserve the `audit:tele_primary=` prefix. Add `audit:tele_secondary=` where §2 specifies.
2. **Apply §3.1 dismissals**: 9 bug-migration legacy ideas → `status: dismissed` + `audit:valid=superseded-by-bug` tag.
3. **Apply §3.2 orphan placements**: 24 orphan ideas gain `audit:tele_primary=tele-N` (+ optional `audit:tele_secondary=tele-M`).
4. **File 3 seed ideas for tele-8** per §4.2.1–4.2.3 (or 1 umbrella idea with 3 sub-items; engineer call).
5. **Replace §4.4 Built/Ratified/Open sketch** with §5 of this critique (3 sub-tables).
6. **Update §0 caveat prose** to reflect: remap now authoritative (cite this critique doc); old-tele-9 is umbrella, not "Determinism".
7. **Update §5 convergence-criteria self-check:** all three criteria pass after revision (every open idea in ≥1 cluster via §2+§3; tele-8 flagged reverse-gap with §4.2 rationale; Built/Ratified/Open per §5).

**Pass 1.1 goes to Director** for ratification per brief §11 step 4. My critique is complete for this round.

---

## 8. Scope boundaries of this critique

**In scope:**
- Old→new tele remap (§1, §2.1)
- Orphan placement (§3)
- Reverse-gap identification + seed proposal (§4)
- Built/Ratified/Open deeper split (§5)
- Answers to Director open-loop questions (§6)

**NOT in scope (deferred / out-of-phase):**
- Per-idea bodies for ideas-not-yet-triaged — relied on tags + titles for placements; any miscall is greg's call to flag during revision
- Mission-numbering cleanup (Q2 — post-review hardening)
- Thread reaper (Q4 — post-review hardening)
- Phase 2 Friction Cartography scope (next phase)
- Phase 3 Concept + Defect extraction (next-next phase)

---

*End of critique. Standing by for engineer revision + Director ratification. Convergence not expected this round; thread stays open for engineer pushback on specific assignments if any.*
