# M-Cognitive-Hypervisor — Work Trace (live state)

**Mission scope.** Tracks all in-flight, queued, and recently-completed work under the M-Cognitive-Hypervisor mission (spec: `docs/planning/m-cognitive-hypervisor.md`). Work-traces live in `docs/traces/` (separate from `docs/planning/` design artifacts). Naming: `<mission-slug>-work-trace.md`, one per overall mission. When a new overall mission is adopted, drop a new trace file into `docs/traces/`; archive a closed trace by renaming to `<mission-slug>-work-trace.closed.md`.

**What this is.** Living document. Tracks every in-flight item, its dependencies, and recent session history. Updated whenever an item changes state. Single source of truth for "what's happening right now" across sessions.

**How to read.** Skim the **resumption pointer** first; then the three status sections (In-flight / Queued / Done this session); then the edges if you need dependency context. Use the session log at the bottom to reconstruct history across restarts.

**Update discipline.**
- Flip a status prefix when state changes (▶/✅/○/⏸)
- Add new items under the right section — never create a parallel list
- Append to session log; don't edit prior entries
- Update resumption pointer when the "current in-flight" changes

**Status legend.**
- ▶ in-flight (currently working or next-up)
- ✅ done (this session; moves to closing audit on phase close)
- ○ queued / filed (waiting on dependency or triage)
- ⏸ deferred (explicit decision to not pursue now)

---

## Resumption pointer (cold-session brief)

If you're picking up cold, read in this order:

1. **This file, then** `docs/audits/phase-2x-closing.md` (most recent closed phase) and `docs/audits/phase-2c-closing.md` (preceding).
2. **Current in-flight:** nothing. task-304 + task-305 both `completed` (architect-reviewed ✓). **Prod backfill executed this session — 846 entities migrated, 0 errors, 0 mismatches after verify-logic patch.** Shim-removal eligible ~2026-04-22 AEST (48h soak). F fully unblocked.
3. **Awaiting architect triage:** idea-115 (dynamic tool scope), idea-116 (tele-10 Precision Context Engineering), idea-118 (cross-item circuit breaker), **idea-121 (API v2.0 tool-surface modernization)**, **idea-122 (`reset_agent` operator affordance)**, **idea-124 (label routing semantics — reserved keys + sender-default inheritance + Agent-SSOT dispatch resolution; supersedes bug-18 caller-patch long-term)**.
4. **Awaiting architect / director triage:** **bug-16 (Agent lifecycle — no reaper + labels/role not refreshed on reconnect; major)**, bug-17 (clientName "unknown" from dev-channel plugin). bug-14 + bug-15 SCOPED (see CP4 + CP2 entries). bug-18 + bug-19 shipped + resolved.
5. **Deferred:** H (Phase 4 quota — no 429s observed), bug-13 (id-sort lexicographic tail refinement).
6. **Role & session plumbing.** Role is set by the adapter at startup (plugin config / `hub-config.json`) — not by the LLM. `McpAgentClient.runHandshake` auto-calls `register_role` on connect; do not re-register. MCP tool-discovery is per-session — if Hub shipped new tools since last connect, restart the session. If role uncertain, confirm via `get_engineer_status`.
7. **Recent commits:** `git log --grep='M-Cognitive-Hypervisor\|task-30' --oneline -20` for code trail.

## In-flight

_(nothing claimed — task-304 + task-305 architect-reviewed ✓ this session (both `completed`). Architect triage pending on ideas 115/116/118/121/122/124 and bugs 16/17. bug-14 absorbed into CP4 scope; bug-15 absorbed into CP2 scope; both per architect task-304 review follow-ups. Bugs 18/19 RESOLVED via commits ace5cbd + fd0710b.)_

---

## Queued / filed

- ○ **D-CP2** — Phase 2d Checkpoint 2: Protocol standardization + messaging. `ThreadConvergenceGateError` → instructional format; universal `_ois_query_unmatched`; stale-staged-action revalidation. **+ new `get_metrics` MCP tool (architect task-304 review add); + INV-TH17 policy-layer instrumentation move (absorbs bug-15).** Unblocked (D-CP1 ✓).
- ○ **D-CP3** — Phase 2d Checkpoint 3: Reaper + lifecycle GC + queue/thread bidirectional integrity. Summary-only truncation on close; `pending_action.abandon` on thread GC; thread-side event on `prune_stuck_queue_items`. Independent of D-CP1/CP2; also addresses bug-16 (Agent reaper + label refresh).
- ○ **D-CP4** — Phase 2d Checkpoint 4: `retry_cascade` tool. **+ update-handler idempotency hardening bundled in (absorbs bug-14) per architect task-304 review.** Unblocked (D-CP1 spawn-handler certification ✓).
- ○ **E** — Mission Phase 3 (state hydration + reconciliation, idea-114, ADR-020). Adapter preloads authoritative Hub state into prompt preamble; `verify_thread_state` pre-flight on mutating calls; re-hydrate on drift. Original canonical mission Phase 3. Gated on Phase 2d completion.
- ○ **F** — idea-119 Phase 2. Extend filter+sort to `list_ideas` + `list_threads` + other list_* tools. idea-120 ratified (thread-225), task-305 (Phase A createdBy) shipped + architect-reviewed ✓. Architect cleared Phase C. **Prod backfill executed this session — all 846 entities have `createdBy`. FULLY UNBLOCKED.** Awaiting architect task issuance for Phase C implementation.
- ○ **G** — idea-119 Phase 3. Projection (`fields:`) + lazy indexing. Gated on F.
- ○ **idea-115** — Dynamic tool scope management. Architect-triage-pending.
- ○ **idea-116** — Tele-10 "Precision Context Engineering" proposal. Architect-triage-pending.
- ○ **idea-118** — Cross-item circuit breaker (idea-117 criterion #4 deferred). Architect-triage-pending.
- ○ **idea-121** — API v2.0 tool-surface modernization: verb-namespace discipline (`get_*` pure read vs `claim_*` dequeue), `get_resource({id})` consolidation, `get_resource_shape({entity})` introspection, pagination envelope + error-payload standardization. Absorbs `claim_task` rename + missing get-by-id. Partial superset of 115/116/119/120. Architect-triage-pending.
- ○ **idea-122** — `reset_agent` operator affordance. Polymorphic-by-status (offline → delete; online → resync or force-kill). Complements bug-16's automatic-label-refresh fix. Architect-triage-pending.
- ○ **idea-124** — Label routing semantics redesign: reserved keys (`env`, `vrf`, `net`) + sender-default inheritance + cross-scope opt-in + Agent-SSOT dispatch-time resolution. Supersedes bug-18 caller-patch long-term (silent-cross-scope-delivery risk the current fix introduces). Phase A = reserved-label registry + type scaffolding; Phase C = thread-policy migration. Architect-triage-pending.
- ○ **task-305 shim cleanup** — Remove migrate-on-read shims (`migrateIdeaOnRead` in `gcs-idea.ts`, `normalizeThreadShape` in `gcs-state.ts`). Backfill completed 2026-04-21 AEST; target removal window = on or after 2026-04-22 AEST (48h soak per architect review). Safe to schedule whenever engineer picks it up.
- ○ **bug-14** — update_idea / update_mission_status no-op detection gap. ABSORBED INTO CP4 scope per architect task-304 review (update-handler idempotency hardening bundled with retry_cascade).
- ○ **bug-15** — INV-TH17 turn-pinning throws lack dedicated shadow-invariant instrumentation. ABSORBED INTO CP2 scope per architect task-304 review (move instrumentation to policy-layer catch site).
- ⏸ **bug-16** — Agent entity lifecycle gaps: no reaper GC + labels/role not refreshed on reconnect. Major; surfaced during kate co-location test. D-CP3 candidate.
- ⏸ **bug-17** — Agent.clientMetadata.clientName reports "unknown" from dev-channel plugin handshake. Minor; likely MCP initialize clientInfo announcement gap.
- ⏸ **H** — Mission Phase 4 (quota integration, idea-109). Deferred per mission doc — no observed 429s to justify pull-forward.
- ⏸ **bug-13** — `list_tasks` sort on `id` is lexicographic, not numeric. Minor severity; workaround = sort by `createdAt`. Absorbs into idea-119 Phase 2 scope (new `entity-id` typed field comparator).

## Done this session

- ✅ **Phase 2x CLOSED** — 7 items shipped: GCS persistence (P0-1), health-check wrapper (P0-2), pagination nudge (P1-3), engineer-side pipeline (P1-5), first-class Director RBAC (P2-6), deploy-script hardening (P2-7). Closing audit `docs/audits/phase-2x-closing.md`. Commit `7c83faa`.
- ✅ **A (task-302)** — M-QueryShape Phase 1: `list_tasks` filter + sort + `_ois_query_unmatched` + queryShape telemetry + Summarizer-respects-limit. Brainstorm: thread-222. Commit `177fb84`. Architect-reviewed ✓.
- ✅ **B (thread-223)** — Threads 2.0 Phase 2 design brainstorm. 5 rounds, bilateral convergence. Ratified Phase 2a scope.
- ✅ **C (task-303)** — Threads 2.0 Phase 2a: per-action commit authority (`REQUIRED_CONVERGER_ROLE` + max-privilege rule) + Director notification on `cascade_failed`. Commit `9a5e7d0`. Architect-reviewed ✓.
- ✅ **D-brainstorm (thread-224)** — Phase 2d Robustness Audit scope. 5 rounds, bilateral convergence. Ratified 4-checkpoint path (CP1 observability → CP4 protocol → CP2 reaper → CP3 retry_cascade), idempotency-first over Hub atomicity, staging role-unrestricted, authority at convergence.
- ✅ **D-CP1 (task-304)** — Phase 2d CP1 shipped across 5 commits (`eab52be` → `a6d5bb0`). Metrics primitive + shadow-invariant logger + cascade-failure-type buckets + idempotency contract tests (5/5 spawn handlers CERTIFIED) + audit report `docs/audits/phase-2d-cp1-observability-report.md`. 503 Hub tests + 96 network-adapter tests passing. **Architect-reviewed ✓ (assessment: Fully Completed); task status = `completed`.** Review follow-ups absorbed: CP2 picks up new `get_metrics` MCP tool + INV-TH17 policy-layer move (bug-15); CP4 picks up update-handler idempotency hardening (bug-14).
- ✅ **task-305** — Mission-24 Phase A shipped across 4 commits (`613cf29` → `add9d0f`). Director-approved atomic A+B+D collapse (thread-226). `EntityProvenance` type; `createdBy` required on Thread + Idea (legacy `author` / `initiatedBy` REMOVED); additive on 8 other entities; `resolveCreatedBy(ctx)` helper; migrate-on-read shims; one-shot `scripts/backfill-created-by.ts`. 510 Hub tests passing. **Architect-reviewed ✓ (assessment: Fully Completed); task status = `completed`.** Phase C (F) cleared to proceed as separate task; shim-cleanup follow-up backlogged. F now gated only on prod backfill run.
- ✅ **prod backfill executed** — `scripts/backfill-created-by.ts --apply --verify` against `gs://ois-relay-hub-state`. 846 entities migrated (Idea 124 fromLegacy, Thread 227 fromLegacy, Task 4 fromAudit + 301 placeholder, Mission 2 fromAudit + 34 placeholder, Proposal/Turn/Tele/Bug/PendingActionItem/DirectorNotification 155 placeholder). 0 errors, 0 OCC retries. Verify-logic false-positive surfaced on Thread sample (8/26 apparent mismatches where audit=architect actually referenced `auto_thread_reply`, not thread creation) — root cause: `resolveFromAudit` fell through when `auditActionPrefixes` was undefined, matching the first audit entry regardless of action type. Data itself was correct; patched verify to require non-empty prefixes (one-line change). Re-verify = 0 mismatches across all types. Shim-cleanup eligible from 2026-04-22 AEST onward.
- ✅ **thread-226** — task-305 scope-revision heads-up converged bilaterally. Architect ratified director's atomic-cutover call with 4 technical recommendations — all absorbed into C1-C4.
- ✅ **idea-120 triage (thread-225)** — entity-provenance unification ratified bilaterally. Canonical `createdBy: {role, agentId}`; `surfacedBy` stays distinct (Bug discovery channel ≠ agent identity); mandatory audit-trail backfill; prereq for F. Architect issued Phase A impl task-305 (shipped — see task-305 entry above).
- ✅ **bug-19 fix (`fd0710b`)** — `create_thread_reply` auto-settles pending-action by natural key. LLM no longer needs to plumb `sourceQueueItemId` — Hub looks up the caller's open queue item via `findOpenByNaturalKey({targetAgentId, entityRef, dispatchType})`. Natural-key auto-match; explicit id still wins as edge-case escape hatch. 3 new TDD tests in `comms-reliability.test.ts` validated red-then-green. First concrete implementation of ADR-019.
- ✅ **bug-18 fix (`ace5cbd`)** — thread unicast dispatch no longer gates on `matchLabels`. Kate cross-env (architect env=prod → kate env=dev) repro resolved: thread-policy strips `matchLabels` from unicast `openSelector` + per-participant reply dispatch. Mission-19 store-level selector semantic preserved (safety-check `engineerId + matchLabels` AND-combine retained). 2 new TDD tests validate the selector shape. Short-term patch; idea-124 proposes the principled redesign.
- ✅ **ADR-019 (`ad7fbb5`)** — Semantic/Plumbing Split principle formalized. LLM expresses cognition (message, intent, converged, stagedActions, summary); Hub derives plumbing (correlation ids, labels, target addressing, SSE binding). bug-19 fix is the first concrete implementation; idea-121 Phase B absorbs retrofit audit across existing tools; idea-124 applies the principle at the dispatch-scope layer. Ratifies idea-123.
- ✅ **Ideas filed:** idea-119 (query-shape engineering), idea-120 (entity-provenance unification), idea-121 (API v2.0 tool-surface modernization), idea-122 (`reset_agent` operator affordance), idea-123 (semantic/plumbing split — ratified as ADR-019 this session), idea-124 (label routing semantics redesign).
- ✅ **Bugs filed:** bug-13 (id-sort lexicographic), bug-14 (update-kind no-op detection gap), bug-15 (INV-TH17 shadow-instrumentation gap), bug-16 (Agent lifecycle gaps — no reaper + labels/role not refreshed on reconnect), bug-17 (clientName "unknown" from dev-channel plugin handshake), bug-18 (SSE unicast cross-env drop — **fix shipped `ace5cbd`**), bug-19 (create_thread_reply plumbs sourceQueueItemId — **fix shipped `fd0710b`**).

## Session log (append-only)

- **2026-04-21 late** — **prod backfill executed** against `gs://ois-relay-hub-state`. Director authorized via labops service-account key. Dry-run clean → `--apply --verify` completed across 846 entities, 0 errors, 0 OCC retries. Verify-sample surfaced 8/26 apparent Thread mismatches (stored=engineer, audit=architect). Investigation of thread-88 + thread-28 confirmed the finding was a **false positive**: `Thread.initiatedBy` correctly captured the opener; the "audit=architect" match was `auto_thread_reply` (reply, not creation). Root cause traced to `resolveFromAudit` fallback when `auditActionPrefixes` was undefined. One-line patch requires non-empty prefixes; re-verify = 0 mismatches everywhere. Shim-removal window opens 2026-04-22 AEST; F fully unblocked pending architect task issuance for Phase C.
- **2026-04-21 evening** — architect reviews landed for task-304 + task-305; both approved (assessment = Fully Completed; status = `completed`). Review follow-ups absorbed into work-trace: **CP2 scope gains** `get_metrics` MCP read tool + INV-TH17 policy-layer instrumentation move (= bug-15); **CP4 scope gains** update-handler idempotency hardening for `update_idea` + `update_mission_status` (= bug-14) bundled with `retry_cascade`; **new backlog entry** for shim-cleanup (remove `migrateIdeaOnRead` + `normalizeThreadShape` ~2 weeks post prod backfill). F (idea-119 Phase 2) unblocked — pending only the Director-triggered prod backfill run of `scripts/backfill-created-by.ts`. **Next-steps decision pending** on whether to prioritize CP2 (protocol + observability cleanup), CP3 (reaper + bug-16), CP4 (retry_cascade), or F (Phase C filter/sort extension).
- **2026-04-21 afternoon** — Kate cross-env dispatch resolution sprint. TDD-disciplined trio: bug-19 fix (`fd0710b`) auto-matches pending-action by natural key, strips `sourceQueueItemId` plumbing from `create_thread_reply`; bug-18 fix (`ace5cbd`) drops `matchLabels` from unicast thread dispatch selectors at the caller layer (thread-policy) — Mission-19 store-level safety-check semantic preserved; ADR-019 (`ad7fbb5`) formalizes the Semantic/Plumbing Split design principle (LLM expresses cognition; Hub handles correlation). Filed idea-124 (label routing semantics redesign — reserved keys, sender-default inheritance, cross-scope opt-in, Agent-SSOT dispatch-time resolution; supersedes the bug-18 caller-patch long-term, closes the silent-cross-scope-delivery risk it introduces). 520 hub tests + 96 network-adapter tests pass.
- **2026-04-21 early** — task-305 (Mission-24 Phase A entity-provenance unification) shipped across 4 commits `613cf29` → `add9d0f`. Director-approved atomic cutover collapsing A+B+D (thread-226 ratification). Thread + Idea legacy fields REMOVED; `createdBy: EntityProvenance` now canonical across 9 entities; migrate-on-read shims + one-shot GCS backfill script cover existing state. Surfaced 4 bugs (14/15/16/17) + filed idea-122 (reset_agent) during Kate co-location test: Agent reaper absent, labels not refreshed on reconnect, clientName reported "unknown" from dev-channel plugin. Manually deleted stale Agent `eng-2c249473aa50` via `gcloud storage rm` so Kate could reconnect with fresh dev-env labels. 510 Hub tests + 96 network-adapter tests pass; Hub report filed, task-305 status = `in_review`.
- **2026-04-20 night** — D-CP1 (task-304) shipped across 5 commits `eab52be` → `a6d5bb0`. Scope delivered: metrics primitive + shadow-invariant logger wired at INV-TH18/19/25 sites; cascade-failure-type taxonomy (`cascade_fail.*`, `convergence_gate.*`); idempotency contract tests (5/5 spawn handlers CERTIFIED: create_task/proposal/idea/bug/propose_mission); audit report `docs/audits/phase-2d-cp1-observability-report.md` with findings (update_idea no-op-detection gap; INV-TH17 instrumentation gap; no metrics-read-endpoint yet) + recommendations for CP2/CP3/CP4. Hub report filed, task-304 status = `in_review`. 503 hub tests + 96 network-adapter tests pass. CP4 substrate ready (caveat: update-handler hardening recommended in parallel).
- **2026-04-20 evening-late** — thread-225 (idea-120 triage) converged bilaterally in 4 rounds. Architect ratified `createdBy: {role, agentId}` (refined — dropped `at` per DRY; top-level `createdAt` is already authoritative), kept `surfacedBy` distinct on Bug (discovery channel ≠ agent identity), mandatory audit-trail backfill, prereq for F. Architect issued **task-305** (Mission-24 Phase A — createdBy schema + `create_*` handler population); `pending`, unclaimed. Filed **idea-121** (API v2.0 tool-surface modernization): verb discipline (`get_*` pure read vs `claim_*` dequeue), `get_resource({id})` consolidation, `get_resource_shape({entity})` introspection, pagination envelope + error-payload standardization. Director-surfaced during task-305 retrieval where no native get-by-id path forced `list_tasks`+jq-on-1.28MB workaround; idea-121 absorbs the minor `claim_task` rename + `get_task_by_id` fix into a strategic v2.0 arc.
- **2026-04-20 late** — shipped task-302 (A) + task-303 (C); opened + converged thread-223 (B) + thread-224 (D-brainstorm); filed idea-120 (provenance unification) + bug-13 (id-sort); this work-trace doc stood up (supersedes post-phase-2x-roadmap.md). Architect reviewed task-302 + task-303 as fully completed. task-304 (D-CP1) issued by architect, pre-assigned to `eng-0d2c690e7dd5`, awaiting director go-ahead to begin implementation.
- **2026-04-20 evening** — opened **thread-225** for idea-120 architect triage (entity-provenance unification / `createdBy` ratification). Unicast to architect, currentTurn=architect. Trace hygiene correction: task-304 is pre-assigned + status=`working` (not "not yet claimed" as prior entry said). Diagnostic: Hub revision `hub-00037-h9t` deployed 2026-04-20T06:40:53 is current (past commits 177fb84 + 9a5e7d0); MCP plugin-proxy in this session still serves pre-Phase-1 `list_tasks` schema (no filter/sort) — schema cached in proxy, resolved by session restart. Flagged, not blocking.
- **2026-04-20 mid** — Phase 2x shipped all 7 items (P0-1 through P2-7); closing audit committed.
- **2026-04-20 early** — Phase 2c CLOSED (failure-amplification class squashed per idea-117).
- **2026-04-19** — Phase 2b CLOSED (83% Gemini-token reduction; three classes squashed).
- (prior phase history in `docs/audits/phase-*.md`)

## Why this shape (rationale kept from prior roadmap doc)

Preserved for cross-session context on the A-I ordering decisions.

### Why A first (shipped)

task-302 was architect-issued production work; leaving it un-claimed violated the task execution discipline. It also targeted the highest-impact failure mode from the Phase 2x N=20 measurement (query-shape regression on tool-heavy/parallel/design prompts).

### Why B parallel with A (shipped)

Pure design work (architect brainstorm), no conflict with engineer-session tool surface. Completing B's brainstorm during A's implementation gave us a ratified Phase 2a design ready for implementation the moment A shipped.

### Why C before E (shipped; E pending)

Phase 3 is a content problem (what state to pre-load into prompts). Threads 2.0 Phase 2 was a machinery problem (how thread convergence spawns downstream work). Machinery smaller than content; shipping C first meant Phase 3 design sessions could USE `stage_task` primitive from day one.

### Why D-brainstorm before D-impl (both shipped)

Robustness audit scope wasn't pre-defined. Brainstorm produced 4-checkpoint ratified path + architect-ratified scope decisions (idempotency-first, no Hub atomicity, collaborative drafting preserved). Without that step, implementation would have been scattered.

### Why idea-120 was promoted to a blocker on F (this session's finding)

Filed during A (task-302) when `author` was listed as filterable but Task had no author field. During the work-trace write-up, director sharpened the unification question into a concrete `createdBy: {role, agentId, at}` proposal. F's value (filter by "who made this") is materially diminished without this unification.

### Why H (Phase 4 quota) stays deferred

Mission doc's own deferral decision — no observed 429s to justify pull-forward. Remains valid.

### Why I (remaining architect-triage ideas) stays lowest

None of idea-115, 116, 118 is load-bearing for current production stability. Triage them when Phase 3 + 4 complete OR when one surfaces as a prerequisite for an in-flight mission.
