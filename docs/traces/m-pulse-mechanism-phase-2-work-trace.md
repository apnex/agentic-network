# M-Pulse-Mechanism-Phase-2 — Work Trace (live state)

**Mission scope.** Tracks all in-flight, queued, and recently-completed engineer-side work under idea-224 → mission-68 (M-Pulse-Mechanism-Phase-2). Goal: ship pulse-mechanism simplification (strip class-defaults + precondition layer) + 3-layer engineer-cadence-discipline mechanization (#55 closure) + repo-event routing substrate + commit-pushed first handler (Path C). Mission class: substrate-introduction.

**Source idea:** idea-224 (status=triaged via route-(a) skip-direct; pending architect status flip → incorporated post-Phase-5).
**Survey envelope:** `docs/surveys/m-pulse-mechanism-phase-2-survey.md` (Director-ratified 6 picks + Path C scope-expansion).
**Design (RATIFIED):** `docs/designs/m-pulse-mechanism-phase-2-design.md` **v1.0** (commit `9c1ec9b`); bilateral seal at thread-445 finalized round 6 (engineer converged round 5 → architect mirror-converged round 6 → Hub finalized 2 actions executed=2 failed=0).
**Mission entity:** mission-68 candidate (to be created at Phase 5 Manifest; architect-Responsibility per RACI §1.5).
**How to read + update this file:** `docs/methodology/trace-management.md`.

**Status legend:** ▶ in-flight · ✅ done this session · ○ queued / filed · ⏸ deferred

## Resumption pointer (cold-session brief)

If you're picking up cold:

1. **Read this file first.** Then the Survey + Design v0.2 (paths above) on branch `agent-lily/idea-224-phase-3-survey` (architect-recommended rename to `agent-lily/idea-224` pending; see Design §11.1 M6 fold).
2. **Hub entities:** idea-224 (triaged); mission-68 not yet created (Phase 5 Manifest gate).
3. **Phase:** Phase 4 Design — **RATIFIED v1.0**; bilateral seal FINALIZED at thread-445 round 6 (engineer converged R5 → architect mirror-converged R6 → Hub finalized; 2 actions committed + executed); awaiting architect Phase 5 Manifest.
4. **Bilateral thread:** thread-445 (correlationId=`idea-224`); FINALIZED at round 6/20 with `intent: implementation_ready`.
5. **Architect-Responsibility next (Phase 5):**
   - Author `docs/missions/m-pulse-mechanism-phase-2-preflight.md` (Phase 6 artifact)
   - `create_mission` for mission-68 (`plannedTasks[]` + `missionClass="substrate-introduction"` + `pulses` config 10/20)
   - idea-224 status flip: `triaged → incorporated` + `missionId=mission-68`
   - Surface to Director for Phase 7 Release-gate
6. **Engineer-side preferences (all ratified across rounds 1-2):** Candidate (b) `repo-event-handlers.ts` registry; AgentLabels `ois.io/github/login` namespace; `kind=note` + terse body + structured payload; Bash post-process detection; missedThreshold=2 with engineer-runtime overlay; single hub PR + separate adapter PR.
7. **Anti-goals (hold firm; 7 ratified):** AG-1 per-agent-idle (idea-225); AG-2 phase-aware content (#52 deferred); AG-3 cross-pulse coord (#53 superseded); AG-4 additional handlers (idea-227); AG-5 tool-surface (idea-121); AG-6 substrate-replacement; AG-7 architect-push notification (Design-time refinement; idea-227).
8. **NOT my work yet:** Hub-side substrate implementation (Phase 8 Execution). Phase 4 = Design v1.0 ratify; Phase 5+ = Manifest → Preflight → Release-gate → Execution.

## Done this session

- ✅ **Round-1 audit on Survey + Design v0.1** — content-level scrutiny per audit-rubric; 5 CRITICAL + 8 MEDIUM + 3 MINOR + 4 PROBE = 20 findings within mission-67 thread-439 envelope. Architect-thread-reply ratifies all 5 CRITICAL fixes (especially C1 §9 ADR-027 §2.6 substrate-misdiagnosis caught + corrected — `noAckSinceLastFire` 3-condition guard preserved orthogonal to precondition layer). Reply at thread-445 round 2.
- ✅ **Round-2 verify on Design v0.2 (commit `1fb59b2`)** — diff-confirmed 5/5 CRITICAL clean, 7/8 MEDIUM clean (M1 partial-fold flagged: thread-claim doesn't match document text), 3/3 MINOR clean, 7/7 PROBE ratified + 1 NEW micro-PROBE surfaced (P8 — §7 row 3 `missionClass`-absent pre-existing `proposed` mission backward-compat). Reply at thread-445 round 4.
- ✅ **Engineer-Responsibility from P7 ratification** — work-trace opened (this file) per `engineer-runtime.md` work-trace discipline; Phase 4 start open-point.
- ✅ **Round-3 verify-quick on Design v1.0 (commit `9c1ec9b`)** — diff-confirmed v0.2→v1.0 deltas (+9/-1 = 8 net): M1 §2.4 two-message-intent paragraph landed verbatim from round-2 reply suggestion; P8 §7 ratification option-(a) accept-post-v1.0-unified-semantics-override; status header v0.2→v1.0. No regressions; no new content-level surfaces. v1.0 ratifiable.
- ✅ **Bilateral seal at thread-445 round 5** — `converged=true` + `stagedActions: [close_no_action]` (action-1; reason: Phase 4 ratified; downstream actions architect-Responsibility per RACI §1.5) + non-empty summary narrative. Hub gate accepted. Turn returned to architect for mirror-converge at round 6.
- ✅ **Phase 8 W1 implementation 9/9 deliverables shipped** (D1-D9 commits 5fc6c5a→e0ac347 on `agent-lily/idea-224`):
  - D1: repo-event-handlers.ts registry (NEW; structurally distinct from triggers.ts; missing handler = WARN log per P1)
  - D2: repo-event-author-lookup.ts primitive (NEW; AgentLabels `ois.io/github/login` per C4+P2)
  - D3: dispatch wiring in message-policy.ts createMessage post-create cascade (cascade-bounded; failure-isolated)
  - D4: COMMIT_PUSHED_HANDLER first handler (terse body + structured payload per M2 + #41 STRUCTURAL ANCHOR; emits ONLY for engineer-pushes per AG-7)
  - D5: pulse simplification (precondition layer removed; PRESERVED registry + thread-still-active + task-not-completed entries per C2; PRESERVED 3-condition guard INTACT per CRITICAL C1)
  - D6: unified default cadence 10/20 + missedThreshold reduce-to-2 (DEFAULT_ENGINEER_PULSE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=600; DEFAULT_ARCHITECT_PULSE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=1200; buildDefaultPulses() helper)
  - D7: update_mission FSM-handler proposed→active auto-inject (P8 ratification; NOT gated behind missionClass)
  - D8: ADR-027 in-place amendments + mission-lifecycle.md §4.x rewrite + §1.5.1.1 NEW expansion + engineer-runtime.md NEW row
  - D9: tests (15 NEW + UPDATED across 3 files; 60 affected tests pass; full hub 1064 pass / 0 regressions)
- ⚠️ **D10 Pass 10 rebuild OPERATOR-DEFERRED** — Cloud Build access denied (GCP org policy); Hub container belongs to architect session per memory. Substantive verification: typecheck clean + 1064 tests pass / 0 regressions. Architect/operator action required at PR review or post-merge gate.

Substrate-already-shipped upstream: `packages/repo-event-bridge/` (mission-52) — idea-224 BUILDS routing layer downstream (consumer of `payload.kind === "repo-event"` messages). Bridge ships `commit-pushed` subkind already; no additional bridge work this mission.

Composable downstream missions:
- **idea-225** M-TTL-Liveliness-Design — composes per-agent-idle work post-mission-68 (tele-8 sequencing dependency)
- **idea-227** M-Hook-Design-End-to-End — consumes mission-68 routing substrate; ships additional handlers (pr-opened/closed/merged/etc.) + meta-mechanization layer + symmetric architect-push coverage (AG-7 territory)

## Session log (append-only; AEST)

### 2026-05-01 (AEST) — Phase 4 round-1 audit + round-2 verify + work-trace open

- 12:39 AEST — Architect (lily) opened thread-445 with Phase 4 Design dispatch; Survey + Design v0.1 fetchable on `agent-lily/idea-224-phase-3-survey` (HEAD `ee678d7`); 7 architect-flag probes batched.
- 12:47 AEST — Engineer (greg) round-1 audit reply at thread-445 round 2: 5 CRITICAL + 8 MEDIUM + 3 MINOR + 4 PROBE = 20 findings. Critical findings cluster around (a) precondition-layer scope confusion (C1 + C2 mis-frame the registry/guard relationship; especially C1 substrate-bug-fix on `noAckSinceLastFire` 3-condition guard which is orthogonal to precondition layer) + (b) backward-compat under-specification (C3 named `update_mission` FSM-handler implementation surface; C5 named distribution-packaging carve-out from v1.2 empirical anchoring). Engineer-side preferences: AgentLabels `ois.io/github/login` namespace (lower-friction than schema extension); Bash tool result post-process detection; single hub PR + separate adapter PR.
- 13:03 AEST — Architect (lily) Design v0.2 (commit `1fb59b2`) shipped on same branch; thread-445 round 3 reply ratifies all 20 findings folded.
- 13:12 AEST — Engineer (greg) round-2 verify at thread-445 round 4: 5/5 CRITICAL clean (especially C1 substrate-bug-fix robustly anchored across §4.2 + §9); 7/8 MEDIUM clean (M1 §2.4 partial-fold flagged: thread-claim says option (a) folded but `git diff ee678d7..1fb59b2 -- ...` shows §2.4 dispatch wiring text unchanged; engineer-recommended paragraph in reply); 3/3 MINOR clean; 7/7 PROBE ratified + 1 NEW micro-PROBE surfaced (P8). Standing for architect Round-3 close.
- 13:13 AEST — Work-trace opened (this file) per P7 ratification; engineer-Responsibility discharged.
- 13:14 AEST — Architect (lily) Design v1.0 (commit `9c1ec9b`) shipped on same branch; thread-445 round 4 reply ratifies M1 §2.4 paragraph landed verbatim + P8 architect-decision option-(a) accept-post-v1.0-unified-semantics-override. Architect invites engineer round-3 verify-quick + bilateral seal at next round.
- 13:15 AEST — Engineer (greg) round-3 verify-quick at thread-445 round 5: diff-confirmed v0.2→v1.0 deltas clean (+9/-1 = 8 net); no regressions; no new content-level surfaces. Bilateral seal: `converged=true` with `close_no_action` staged (action-1) + summary narrating 5-round bilateral convergence. **Phase 4 Design v1.0 RATIFIED.** Engineer-side Phase 4 work complete; awaiting architect mirror-converge at round 6.
- 13:16 AEST — Architect (lily) mirror-converge at thread-445 round 6; Hub fired `thread_convergence_finalized` event with `intent: implementation_ready`. **2 actions committed + executed (failed=0)**: engineer-side action-1 + architect-side mirror action-2. Bilateral converge complete. Architect-Responsibility next: Phase 5 Manifest (`docs/missions/m-pulse-mechanism-phase-2-preflight.md` + `create_mission` for mission-68 with `plannedTasks[]` + `missionClass="substrate-introduction"` + `pulses` config 10/20) + idea-224 status flip (`triaged → incorporated` + `missionId=mission-68`) + Phase 6 Preflight + Phase 7 Release-gate Director engagement.
- 13:24 AEST — Architect (lily) compressed Phase 5/6/7 same-day: mission-68 created (status=active per Director Phase 7 Release-gate "Mission go" 2026-05-01); idea-224 flipped triaged→incorporated; Preflight artifact pushed (`docs/missions/m-pulse-mechanism-phase-2-preflight.md`; commit `ead8f30`; verdict GREEN; 6-category audit). W1 dispatched as task-390 to engineer (greg).
- 13:25 AEST — Engineer (greg) claimed task-390 (W1 hub binding-artifact). Branch rename per M6 fold: `agent-lily/idea-224-phase-3-survey` → `agent-lily/idea-224` (new ref pushed; old ref left in place non-destructively). First W1 commit (5fc6c5a): work-trace open per P7 ratification.
- 13:31 AEST — D1+D2+D3+D4 substrate commit (5743d10): `repo-event-handlers.ts` registry + `repo-event-author-lookup.ts` primitive (AgentLabels `ois.io/github/login` reserved-key approach per C4+P2) + `repo-event-commit-pushed-handler.ts` first handler (terse body + structured payload per M2+#41) + `message-policy.ts` createMessage post-create cascade dispatch wiring (cascade-bounded; failure-isolated). Hub tsc clean.
- 13:36 AEST — D5+D6 commit (1bcc28b): pulse simplification (precondition layer removed; PRESERVED registry + thread-still-active + task-not-completed entries per C2; PRESERVED 3-condition guard INTACT per CRITICAL C1) + unified default cadence (DEFAULT_MISSED_THRESHOLD 3→2; DEFAULT_ENGINEER_PULSE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=600; DEFAULT_ARCHITECT_PULSE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=1200; buildDefaultPulses() helper; createMission auto-injects when pulses omitted). Hub tsc clean.
- 13:42 AEST — D7 commit (98de098): update_mission FSM-handler at proposed→active flip auto-injects unified 10/20/2 defaults via preparePulsesForStorage reuse; P8 ratification (NOT gated behind missionClass !== undefined). Hub tsc clean.
- 13:48 AEST — D8 commit (392f454): ADR-027 amendments (in-place §2.1+§2.6+§2.8+§4.5 edits per Design §9; §2.6 PRESERVED INTACT per C1 explicitly noted; mission-68 co-shipping note in §4.5 per MIN1) + mission-lifecycle.md §4.x rewrite for unified-defaults regime + §1.5.1.1 NEW expansion (3-layer mechanization stack) + engineer-runtime.md NEW row for commit-push thread-heartbeat mechanization (separate from existing #57 routing row per MIN3; references 20/40min escalation horizon per M4).
- 13:53 AEST — D9 commit (e0ac347): tests (15 NEW for repo-event-handlers + author-lookup + COMMIT_PUSHED_HANDLER; UPDATED mission-pulse-schema for mission-68 semantics; UPDATED pulse-sweeper E2 3-condition guard test rewritten for pulseFiredAtLeastOnce path per CRITICAL C1 pinning; NEW FSM-handler proposed→active flip describe block 4 tests). Full hub suite: 1064 pass / 5 pre-existing skip / 0 regressions. tsc --noEmit clean.
- 13:55 AEST — D10 Pass 10 rebuild ATTEMPTED via `OIS_ENV=prod ./scripts/local/build-hub.sh`; **BLOCKED on GCP Cloud Build auth** (org policy: user lacks serviceusage.services.use permission to access labops-389703_cloudbuild bucket). Direct local `docker build` would require manual replication of build-hub.sh tarball-staging logic AND restart of Hub container which belongs to architect's session per memory. **Operator-deferred:** Pass 10 rebuild + container restart requires architect/user action at PR review or post-merge gate. Substantive verification: typecheck clean + 1064 tests pass / 0 regressions.
