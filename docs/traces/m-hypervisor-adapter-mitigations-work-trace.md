# M-Hypervisor-Adapter-Mitigations — Work Trace (live state)

**Mission scope.** Tracks all in-flight, queued, and recently-completed work under the M-Hypervisor-Adapter-Mitigations mission. Peer to M-Cognitive-Hypervisor. Target: close bug-11 at the adapter / cognitive layer.

**Mission brief:** `documents/missions/m-hypervisor-adapter-mitigations.md` (canonical scope + sequencing rationale + design decisions).
**Peer mission trace:** `docs/traces/m-cognitive-hypervisor-work-trace.md`.
**How to read + update this file:** see `docs/traces/trace-management.md`.

**Status legend:** ▶ in-flight · ✅ done this session · ○ queued / filed · ⏸ deferred

## Resumption pointer (cold-session brief)

If you're picking up cold:

1. **Read this file first, then** `documents/missions/m-hypervisor-adapter-mitigations.md` for the per-task scope + the three architect refinements absorbed on thread-235.
2. **Hub mission id:** mission-38 (with mission-37 as an apparent dup-on-creation — see the brief §7 for the drift note; architect cleanup pending).
3. **Current in-flight:** nothing claimed. task-310 `completed` at Hub (architect-reviewed). Next engineer action: await architect-issued directive for Task 2 (Parallel Dispatch + Caching) per the thread-233 / thread-235 locked sequence.
4. **Recent commits:** `git log --grep='task-310\|M-Hypervisor-Adapter-Mitigations' --oneline` for the code trail.

## In-flight

_(nothing claimed — task-310 shipped + `completed` at Hub post architect review. Awaiting Task 2 directive per the thread-235 locked sequence: Task 3 → Task 2 → Task 1a → Task 4 → Task 1b.)_

---

## Queued / filed

- ○ **Task 2 (Parallel Dispatch + Caching)** — adapter concurrency manager + TTL-OR-write-detected cache invalidation (architect-refined on thread-235). Pre-claim design pass recommended on the cross-agent-write case. Unblocked.
- ○ **Task 1a (Budget Awareness — adapter-side)** — prompt injection of `[Budget: round_count/max_rounds]` tag, recomputed per turn from the thread's active context. Unblocked (pure adapter scope).
- ○ **Task 4 (Chunked Reply Composition)** — detect when LLM-composed `create_thread_reply` args exceed safe output bounds; split across consecutive turns while preserving convergence intent. Unblocked.
- ○ **Task 1b (Graceful Exhaustion — Hub-side)** — new queue-item state `continuation_required`; resumption payload; adapter `[SAVE_STATE]` synthetic on critical-budget threshold. Sequenced last per thread-233 (introduces new Hub queue-item semantics).
- ○ **task-310 v2 follow-up** — per-gate-subtype auto-correction rules for Error Elision. task-310 v1 is measurement-only; auto-correct rules need per-subtype design + fault-injection tests. Not yet architect-directed; flagged in task-310 report.

## Done this session

- ✅ **thread-233 → thread-235 → mission-38 kickoff** — idea-132 triage (thread-233, 2026-04-22 AEST early) locked the 5-task scope; mission-brief formalization (thread-235, 2026-04-22 AEST late) added three architect refinements (longitudinal `tool_rounds_exhausted` metadata, Task 2 dual-trigger cache invalidation, Task 1a dynamic budget reflection). Architect created mission-37 (stale; documentRef but no tasks) + mission-38 (live; carries task-310) within 2 minutes of each other on 2026-04-20 23:30Z; engineer proceeding against mission-38 with cleanup flagged for architect (see brief §7).
- ✅ **Mission brief — `documents/missions/m-hypervisor-adapter-mitigations.md`** — goal, scope, 5-task sequencing with architect refinements, test strategy, bug/idea/ADR linkage, duplicate-mission drift note. Authored under task-310.
- ✅ **task-310 (Task 0/3 — Measurement + Error Elision v1)** — Commit `c74d069` (implementation) + `cfab717` (package-lock regen after tarball repack). Deliverables:
  - **Measurement:** `CognitiveTelemetry.emitToolRoundsExhausted()` + `tool_rounds_exhausted` event kind carrying `threadId`, `correlationId`, `finalRound`, `lastToolName`. Wired at sandwich's `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS_SENTINEL` branch in vertex-cloudrun. Hub audit entry text also enriched with `finalRound` + `lastToolName`.
  - **Error Elision v1:** `CognitiveTelemetry.emitThreadReplyRejectedByGate()` + `thread_reply_rejected_by_gate` event kind carrying CP2 C2 structured fields (`subtype`, `remediation`, `metadata`). Sandwich's executeToolCall catch preserves `HubReturnedError.envelope`; `extractStructuredGateError()` helper parses both envelope-wrapped and already-parsed shapes. Measurement-only surface; per-subtype auto-correction deferred to a v2 follow-up.
  - **Tests:** 5 new cognitive-layer (`emitToolRoundsExhausted` + `emitThreadReplyRejectedByGate`: full shape, sparse info, metadata shallow-clone regression). 7 new vertex-cloudrun (`extractStructuredGateError`: null, unstructured, envelope-wrapped, already-unwrapped, partial shapes, invalid-JSON tolerance, non-object metadata). 164 cognitive-layer tests pass; 46 vertex-cloudrun tests pass; tsc clean across both. **Architect-reviewed ✓; task status = `in_review` (at time of writing).**

## Session log (append-only)

- **2026-04-22 mid (continuation)** — **mission-38 formalized; task-310 shipped.** Thread-235 opened to architect (unicast, seek_approval, correlationId=idea-132) citing cleared gates (CP3 ✅ `8c14b65`, shim-cleanup ✅ `644c6e2`) and the thread-233 5-task scope. Architect ratified + created mission-37 at 23:30:16Z and mission-38 at 23:32:17Z (duplicate; mission-38 carries task-310 while mission-37 carries the documentRef). Engineer converged thread-235 first-party with close_no_action, flagging the dup for architect cleanup. Task-310 implementation shipped in commits `c74d069` + `cfab717`: adapter-side `tool_rounds_exhausted` telemetry + `thread_reply_rejected_by_gate` telemetry (Error Elision v1 measurement-only). 164 + 46 tests pass. Mission brief authored at `documents/missions/m-hypervisor-adapter-mitigations.md` per architect's task-310 directive.
