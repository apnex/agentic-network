## 1. Entity FSM Declarations

### 1.1 Task

```
Entity: Task
States: pending, blocked, working, input_required, in_review, completed, failed, escalated, cancelled
Initial: pending (no dependencies) | blocked (with dependsOn)
Terminal: completed, failed, escalated, cancelled
Additional fields: revisionCount (integer, default 0)
```

#### Transitions

| From             | To              | Trigger                                                    | Actor     |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| (initial)        | pending         | `create_task` (no dependsOn)                               | Architect |
| (initial)        | blocked         | `create_task` (with dependsOn)                             | Architect |
| pending          | working         | `get_task` (atomic assignment)                             | Engineer  |
| pending          | cancelled       | `cancel_task`                                              | Architect |
| blocked          | pending         | All dependencies review-approved (cascade)                 | System    |
| blocked          | cancelled       | Any dependency cancelled (cascade)                         | System    |
| working          | in_review       | `create_report`                                            | Engineer  |
| working          | input_required  | `create_clarification`                                     | Engineer  |
| input_required   | working         | `resolve_clarification`                                    | Architect |
| in_review        | completed       | `create_review(decision: "approved")` — triggers DAG cascade | Architect |
| in_review        | working         | `create_review(decision: "rejected")` — increments revisionCount | Architect |
| in_review        | escalated       | `create_review(decision: "rejected")` when revisionCount >= 3 | System |

**Note:** The `working → completed` and `working → failed` transitions from v1.0.0 are removed. Reports now transition to `in_review`, and only an approved review transitions to `completed`. DAG cascades (`unblockDependents`) trigger on `completed`, not on `in_review`.

#### Report Versioning

Reports and reviews use versioned naming based on `revisionCount`:
- First report: `reports/{taskId}-v1-report.md`
- After rejection and re-report: `reports/{taskId}-v2-report.md`
- Formula: `v{revisionCount + 1}`

#### Invariants

| ID      | Invariant                                                                        | Tested By                          |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| INV-T1  | A task can only be picked up by one engineer (atomic `getNextDirective`)          | `e2e-chaos.test.ts` "only one engineer" |
| INV-T2  | A blocked task is never returned by `get_task`                                   | `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "completing parent unblocks" |
| INV-T3  | Only pending tasks can be cancelled via `cancel_task`                            | `policy-router.test.ts` "cancelTask cancels" |
| INV-T4  | completed, failed, escalated, cancelled are terminal — no outbound transitions   | `e2e-fsm-enforcement.test.ts` "completed is terminal" |
| INV-T5  | Idempotency keys prevent duplicate task creation                                 | `e2e-chaos.test.ts` "duplicate idempotency" |
| INV-T6  | `dependsOn` references must point to existing tasks                              | `policy-router.test.ts` "validates dependsOn" |
| INV-T7  | A task with `dependsOn` starts in `blocked`, not `pending`                       | `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "completing parent" |
| INV-T8  | Only `working` tasks can receive reports (`create_report`)                        | `e2e-fsm-enforcement.test.ts` "rejects report on pending" |
| INV-T9  | DAG cascade (unblockDependents) triggers on review approval, not report submission | NONE |
| INV-T10 | `in_review → working` (rejected) increments `revisionCount`                      | NONE |
| INV-T11 | `revisionCount >= 3` on rejection triggers `escalated` (circuit breaker)         | NONE |
| INV-T12 | `escalated` is locked — `create_report` is rejected from this state              | NONE |

**Resolved gaps:**
- ~~GAP-1~~: `isValidTransition()` is now called in all Task, Idea, Mission, Turn policy handlers (resolved in task-107).
- ~~GAP-9~~: Terminal states are now enforced via FSM guards (resolved in task-107).

### 1.2 Proposal

```
Entity: Proposal
States: submitted, approved, rejected, changes_requested, implemented
Initial: submitted
Terminal: implemented
```

#### Transitions

| From               | To                  | Trigger                    | Actor     |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| (initial)          | submitted           | `create_proposal`          | Engineer  |
| submitted          | approved            | `create_proposal_review`   | Architect |
| submitted          | rejected            | `create_proposal_review`   | Architect |
| submitted          | changes_requested   | `create_proposal_review`   | Architect |
| approved           | implemented         | `close_proposal`           | Engineer  |
| rejected           | implemented         | `close_proposal`           | Engineer  |
| changes_requested  | implemented         | `close_proposal`           | Engineer  |

#### Invariants

| ID       | Invariant                                                                       | Tested By                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| INV-P1   | Only the Architect can review proposals                                         | `e2e-remediation.test.ts` "RBAC enforcement" |
| INV-P2   | Only submitted proposals can be reviewed                                        | NONE (no status guard on `reviewProposal`) |
| INV-P3   | `close_proposal` requires status in {approved, rejected, changes_requested}     | `wave3b-policies.test.ts` "close_proposal fails" |
| INV-P4   | implemented is terminal — no outbound transitions                               | NONE                                   |

~~**Gap: `under_review` phantom state — RESOLVED (task-107): removed from enum.**~~

**Gap (GAP-5):** `reviewProposal` in the store has no status guard — a proposal could theoretically be reviewed multiple times, overwriting previous decisions. The Registry specifies that only `submitted` proposals should be reviewable.

### 1.3 Thread

```
Entity: Thread
States: active, converged, round_limit, closed
Initial: active
Terminal: closed
```

#### Transitions

| From         | To           | Trigger                                              | Actor     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- |

| active       | converged    | `create_thread_reply` (both parties signalled converged) | Any    |
| active       | round_limit  | `create_thread_reply` (roundCount >= maxRounds)      | System    |
| active       | closed       | `close_thread`                                       | Architect |
| converged    | closed       | `close_thread`                                       | Architect |

#### Invariants

| ID       | Invariant                                                                       | Tested By                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| INV-TH1  | Only the current turn holder can reply                                          | `e2e-chaos.test.ts` "reply when not your turn" |
| INV-TH2  | Turn alternates between architect and engineer after each reply                 | `e2e-foundation.test.ts` "thread tracks turn" |
| INV-TH3  | Convergence requires both parties to signal `converged: true`                   | `e2e-foundation.test.ts` "both parties converge" |
| INV-TH4  | `thread_message` targets the opposite role from the author                      | `e2e-foundation.test.ts` "thread convergence" |
| INV-TH5  | `thread_converged` targets architect (for follow-through)                       | `e2e-foundation.test.ts` "thread convergence" |
| INV-TH6  | Replies to non-active threads are rejected                                      | NONE                                     |
| INV-TH7  | `close_thread` can close a thread in any state                                  | NONE (no status guard in store)          |
| INV-TH8  | `escalated` state is set when round_limit is reached                            | NONE (code uses `round_limit`, `escalated` may be unused) |

**Gap: The `escalated` state exists in the enum but it's unclear when it's set vs `round_limit`. The store appears to use `round_limit` when maxRounds is reached. `escalated` may be a phantom state or intended for future Director intervention.**

### 1.4 Idea

```
Entity: Idea
States: open, triaged, dismissed, incorporated
Initial: open
Terminal: (none — ideas can be re-opened in principle)
```

#### Transitions

| From   | To            | Trigger                                          | Actor     |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| (any)  | (any)         | `update_idea` (no FSM guard)                     | Architect |
| (any)  | incorporated  | `update_idea` with missionId (auto-sets status)  | Architect |

#### Invariants

| ID       | Invariant                                                              | Tested By                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| INV-I1   | Incorporating an idea into a mission auto-links it                     | `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "auto-link"   |
| INV-I2   | Auto-linkage failure is non-fatal (idea still updated)                 | NONE                                   |

**Gap: No FSM enforcement. Any status can transition to any other status. The Registry recommends adding guards: `dismissed` should be terminal (or require explicit re-opening), `incorporated` should only be reachable when `missionId` is set.**

---

### 1.5 Mission

```
Entity: Mission
States: proposed, active, completed, abandoned
Initial: proposed
Terminal: completed, abandoned
```

#### Transitions

| From      | To         | Trigger                             | Actor     |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | --------- |
| (initial) | proposed   | `create_mission`                    | Architect |
| proposed  | active     | `update_mission` (status="active")  | Architect |
| active    | completed  | `update_mission` (status="completed") | Architect |
| active    | abandoned  | `update_mission` (status="abandoned") | Architect |

#### Invariants

| ID       | Invariant                                                              | Tested By                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| INV-M1   | Tasks auto-link to mission when `correlationId` matches `mission-\d+`  | `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "auto-link"   |
| INV-M2   | Ideas auto-link to mission via `update_idea` with missionId            | `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "auto-link"   |
| INV-M3   | Auto-linkage failure is non-fatal (task/idea still created)            | `e2e-chaos.test.ts` "non-existent mission" |
| INV-M4   | completed and abandoned are terminal                                   | NONE                                   |

**Gap: No FSM enforcement. `update_mission` sets status directly. A completed mission could be reverted to proposed. The Registry specifies that terminal states must be enforced.**

---

### 1.6 Turn

```
Entity: Turn
States: planning, active, completed
Initial: planning
Terminal: completed
```

#### Transitions

| From      | To         | Trigger                            | Actor     |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |

| planning  | active     | `update_turn` (status="active")    | Architect |
| active    | completed  | `update_turn` (status="completed") | Architect |

#### Invariants

| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| INV-TN1  | completed is terminal                          | NONE      |

**Gap: Same as Mission — no FSM enforcement on transitions.**

### 1.7 Tele (Immutable)

```
Entity: Tele
States: (none — immutable once created)
Mutability: IMMUTABLE — no update or delete operations exist
```

#### Invariants

| ID       | Invariant                                        | Tested By                           |

### 1.8 Audit Entry (Immutable, Append-Only)

```
Entity: Audit Entry
States: (none — append-only log)
Mutability: APPEND-ONLY — entries cannot be modified or deleted
```

#### Invariants

| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| INV-A1   | Audit entries are immutable once created            | NONE (enforced by absence of API)  |

~~**Gap (GAP-6): RESOLVED (task-108)** — actor is now derived from `ctx.stores.engineerRegistry.getRole(ctx.sessionId)`.~~

### 1.9 Document (Stateless)

```
Entity: Document
States: (none — stateless CRUD on GCS)
Mutability: Overwritable (create_document overwrites existing)
```

#### Invariants

| ID       | Invariant                                                           | Tested By |

## 2. Multi-Actor Workflow Declarations

### WF-001 Task Happy Path

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer
Precondition: None
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                          | State After  | Event Emitted                    |
| ---- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| 1    | Architect | `create_task(title, description)`               | pending      | `directive_issued` → [engineer]  |
| 2    | Engineer  | `get_task()`                                    | working      | `directive_acknowledged` → [architect] |
| 3    | Engineer  | `create_report(taskId, ...)`                    | in_review    | `report_submitted` → [architect] |
| 4    | Architect | `create_review(taskId, ..., decision: "approved")` | completed | `review_completed` → [engineer]  |

Step 3 transitions to `in_review` (not `completed`). No DAG cascade fires at this point.
Step 4 transitions to `completed` and triggers DAG cascade (`unblockDependents`) if dependents exist.

**Agent behavior:** Step 4 is automated — the Architect's `sandwichReviewReport` handler fires on `report_submitted`, reads the report from GCS, uses LLM to evaluate, and calls `create_review` with `decision: "approved"`.

**Tested By:** NONE (existing tests use old semantics — will be updated in Mission-6 T5)

### WF-001a Task Revision Loop

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer
Precondition: Task in working state
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                           | State After  | Event Emitted                        |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Engineer  | `create_report(taskId, ...)`                     | in_review    | `report_submitted` → [architect]     |
| 2    | Architect | `create_review(taskId, ..., decision: "rejected")` | working    | `revision_required` → [engineer]     |
| 3    | Engineer  | Reads feedback, revises work                     | working      | (none)                               |
| 4    | Engineer  | `create_report(taskId, ...)`                     | in_review    | `report_submitted` → [architect]     |
| 5    | Architect | `create_review(taskId, ..., decision: "approved")` | completed  | `review_completed` → [engineer]      |

Step 2 increments `revisionCount` and emits `revision_required` with `previousReportRef` and `reviewRef`.
Step 4 generates a versioned report name: `reports/{taskId}-v{revisionCount+1}-report.md`.

**Agent behavior:** Step 2 is automated — `sandwichReviewReport` evaluates the report and may reject with specific feedback. Step 3 requires the Engineer Plugin to surface the `revision_required` event as an actionable prompt.

**Tested By:** NONE (new workflow — will be tested in Mission-6 T5)

---

### WF-001b Task Escalation (Circuit Breaker)

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer, System
Precondition: Task has been rejected 3+ times (revisionCount >= 3)
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                           | State After  | Event Emitted                             |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Engineer  | `create_report(taskId, ...)`                     | in_review    | `report_submitted` → [architect]          |
| 2    | Architect | `create_review(taskId, ..., decision: "rejected")` | escalated  | `director_attention_required` → [architect] |

Step 2: when `revisionCount >= 3`, the system transitions to `escalated` instead of `working`. The `escalated` state is locked — no outbound transitions. The Engineer cannot submit further reports. Requires future Director intervention (e.g., `reset_task` tool).

**Tested By:** NONE (new workflow — will be tested in Mission-6 T5)

### WF-002 Task with Clarification

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer
Precondition: Task exists in working state
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                              | State After     | Event Emitted                          |
| ---- | --------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Engineer  | `create_clarification(taskId, q)`   | input_required  | `clarification_requested` → [architect] |
| 2    | Architect | `resolve_clarification(taskId, a)`  | working         | `clarification_answered` → [engineer]  |

**Agent behavior:** Step 2 is automated — the Architect's `sandwichClarification` handler fires on `clarification_requested`, uses LLM to answer, and calls `resolve_clarification`.

**Tested By:** `e2e-foundation.test.ts` "working → input_required → working state transitions"

### WF-003 Task DAG — Dependency Unblocking

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer, System
Precondition: Two or more tasks with dependency relationships
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                              | State After  | Event Emitted                          |
| ---- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Architect | `create_task("A", ...)`                             | A: pending   | `directive_issued` → [engineer]        |
| 2    | Architect | `create_task("B", ..., dependsOn: ["A"])`           | B: blocked   | `task_blocked` → [architect]           |
| 3    | Engineer  | `get_task()` → picks up A                           | A: working   | `directive_acknowledged` → [architect] |
| 4    | Engineer  | `create_report("A", ...)`                           | A: in_review | `report_submitted` → [architect]       |
| 5    | Architect | `create_review("A", ..., decision: "approved")`     | A: completed | `review_completed` → [engineer]        |
| 6    | System    | Cascade: unblockDependents(A)                       | B: pending   | `directive_issued` → [engineer]        |
| 7    | Engineer  | `get_task()` → picks up B                           | B: working   | `directive_acknowledged` → [architect] |

**Key change (v2.0.0):** Cascade unblocking now happens at Step 6 (after review approval), not at Step 4 (after report). This prevents unblocking dependents before the Architect has verified the work.

**Tested By:** NONE (existing tests use old semantics — will be updated in Mission-6 T5)

### WF-003a Task DAG — Cancel Cascade

```
Actors: Architect, System
Precondition: Parent task with blocked dependents
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                        | State After   | Event Emitted                    |
| ---- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1    | Architect | `cancel_task("A")`                            | A: cancelled  | (none from cancel_task itself)   |
| 2    | System    | Cascade: cancelDependents(A)                  | B: cancelled  | `task_cancelled` → [architect]   |

**Tested By:** `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "cancelling parent cascades cancellation"

### WF-004 Proposal Happy Path

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer

| ---- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1    | Engineer  | `create_proposal(title, summary, body)`    | submitted         | `proposal_submitted` → [architect]  |
| 2    | Architect | `create_proposal_review(id, decision, fb)` | approved          | `proposal_decided` → [engineer]     |
| 3    | Engineer  | `close_proposal(id)`                       | implemented       | (none)                              |

**Agent behavior:** Step 2 is automated — the Architect's `sandwichReviewProposal` handler fires on `proposal_submitted`.

**Tested By:** `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "create → changes_requested → resubmit → approve → close"

---

### WF-004a Proposal with Changes Requested

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer
Precondition: None
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                           | State After         | Event Emitted                       |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1    | Engineer  | `create_proposal(title, summary, body)`          | submitted           | `proposal_submitted` → [architect]  |
| 2    | Architect | `create_proposal_review(id, "changes_requested", fb)` | changes_requested | `proposal_decided` → [engineer]  |
| 3    | Engineer  | `create_proposal(title_v2, summary_v2, body_v2)` | new: submitted      | `proposal_submitted` → [architect]  |
| 4    | Architect | `create_proposal_review(id_v2, "approved", fb)`  | new: approved       | `proposal_decided` → [engineer]     |
| 5    | Engineer  | `close_proposal(id_v2)`                          | new: implemented    | (none)                              |

**Note:** There is no "update proposal" operation. The Engineer creates a new proposal. The original remains in `changes_requested` state permanently.

**Tested By:** `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "create → changes_requested → resubmit → approve → close"

### WF-004b Proposal Rejection

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer
Precondition: Submitted proposal

| Step | Actor     | Action                                       | State After  | Event Emitted                       |
| ---- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1    | Engineer  | `create_proposal(title, summary, body)`      | submitted    | `proposal_submitted` → [architect]  |
| 2    | Architect | `create_proposal_review(id, "rejected", fb)` | rejected     | `proposal_decided` → [engineer]     |

**Tested By:** `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "proposal rejection flow"

### WF-005 Thread Happy Path — Convergence

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer
Precondition: None
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                                        | State After | Event Emitted                       |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |

| 2    | Other     | `create_thread_reply(id, msg, converged: true)`               | active      | `thread_message` → [initiator]     |
| 3    | Initiator | `create_thread_reply(id, msg, converged: true)`               | converged   | `thread_converged` → [architect]   |

**Agent behavior:** Step 3's `thread_converged` event triggers `sandwichThreadConverged`. If intent is `implementation_ready`, the Architect auto-creates a task (with `sourceThreadId`, which auto-closes the thread).

**Tested By:** `e2e-foundation.test.ts` "both parties converge → thread status = converged"

### WF-005a Thread — Convergence to Auto-Directive

```
Actors: Architect (automated), Engineer
Precondition: Thread converged with intent = "implementation_ready"
```

| Step | Actor           | Action                                               | State After          | Event Emitted                     |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |

| 4    | System          | Thread auto-closed by sourceThreadId                 | thread: closed       | —                                 |

**Tested By:** NONE (requires LLM integration — not testable in-memory)

**Note:** This is the only workflow where the Architect autonomously creates tasks without Director instruction.

### WF-006 Mission Lifecycle

```
Actors: Architect
Precondition: None

| 2    | Architect | `update_mission(id, status: "active")`           | active      | `mission_activated` → [architect, engineer] |
| 3    | Architect | `update_mission(id, status: "completed")`        | completed   | (none — no event for completion)            |

**Tested By:** NONE (individual operations tested in `wave2-policies.test.ts` but not as a workflow)

**Cross-domain effect:** Mission's `ideas[]` array updated via `linkIdea`.

**Tested By:** `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "tasks and ideas auto-link to mission"

### WF-008 Event Loop Catch-Up (Agent-Side)

```
Actors: Architect (automated)
Trigger: 300s periodic timer OR state sync on reconnect
Precondition: Architect connected to Hub
```

| Step | Actor           | Action                                    | Effect                                    |

| 2    | Architect (LLM) | Process `unreviewedTasks`                 | Calls `sandwichReviewReport` per task     |
| 3    | Architect (LLM) | Process `pendingProposals`                | Calls `sandwichReviewProposal` per proposal |
| 4    | Architect (LLM) | Process `threadsAwaitingReply`            | Calls `sandwichThreadReply` per thread    |
| 5    | Architect (LLM) | Process `clarificationsPending`           | Calls `sandwichClarification` per task    |

**Note:** `thread_converged` has NO polling backup. If the SSE event is missed and the event loop polls, converged threads are not processed. This is a gap.

**Tested By:** NONE (agent-side, requires LLM)

### XD-001 Task → Mission Auto-Linkage

| Field       | Value                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger     | `create_task` with `correlationId` matching `/^mission-\d+$/`         |
| Effect      | `mission.linkTask(correlationId, taskId)` — adds taskId to mission's tasks[] |
| Failure     | Non-fatal — task is created, linkage failure logged as warning        |
| Tested By   | `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "tasks and ideas auto-link"                  |

### XD-002 Idea → Mission Auto-Linkage

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger     | `update_idea` with `missionId` set, resulting status = `incorporated` |

### XD-003 Task Review Approval → DAG Cascade

| Field       | Value                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger     | `create_review(decision: "approved")` approves a task with blocked dependents |
| Mechanism   | Internal event `task_completed` → `handleTaskCompleted` cascade       |
| Effect      | `task.unblockDependents(taskId)` — transitions each dependent blocked→pending |
| Events      | `directive_issued` → [engineer] per unblocked task                    |
| Failure     | Non-fatal to primary op — `cascade_failure` → [architect]            |
| Tested By   | NONE (existing tests use old trigger — will be updated in Mission-6 T5) |

**Key change (v2.0.0):** Trigger moved from `create_report` to `create_review(approved)`. This ensures dependents are only unblocked after the Architect has verified the prerequisite work.

### XD-004 Task Cancellation → DAG Cascade

| Field       | Value                                                                 |

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger     | `create_task` with `sourceThreadId` set                               |
| Effect      | `thread.closeThread(sourceThreadId)` — closes the originating thread  |
| Failure     | Non-fatal — task is created, close failure logged                     |
| Tested By   | `policy-router.test.ts` "createTask auto-closes source thread"       |

### XD-006 Thread Convergence → Auto-Directive (Agent-Side)

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger     | `thread_converged` SSE event with `intent: "implementation_ready"`    |
| Effect      | Architect LLM generates directive, calls `create_task` with `sourceThreadId` |
| Cascade     | Task creation triggers XD-005 (thread auto-close)                    |
| Failure     | LLM failure — no task created, logged via `create_audit_entry`       |

## 6. Gap Analysis

### 6.1 Specification vs Implementation Gaps

| ID     | Gap                                                                                     | Severity | Status                                              |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| GAP-1  | `TASK_FSM` declared but `isValidTransition()` never called                              | Medium   | **RESOLVED** (task-107) — FSM enforced in all policies |
| GAP-2  | Proposal `under_review` phantom state                                                   | Low      | **RESOLVED** (task-107) — removed from enum          |
| GAP-3  | Thread `escalated` phantom state                                                        | Low      | **RESOLVED** (task-107) — removed from enum          |
| GAP-4  | Idea, Mission, Turn have no FSM guards                                                  | Medium   | **RESOLVED** (task-107) — FSM tables added + enforced |
| GAP-5  | `reviewProposal` has no status guard                                                    | Medium   | Open — only `submitted` proposals should be reviewable |
| GAP-6  | `create_audit_entry` hardcodes actor to "architect"                                     | Low      | **RESOLVED** (task-108) — derived from session role  |
| GAP-7  | `thread_converged` has no event loop polling backup                                     | Medium   | **RESOLVED** (task-108) — added to `pollAndProcess`  |

| GAP-10 | `create_report` transitions to `completed` instead of `in_review`                       | High     | Open — **Mission-6 T2/T3** will implement `in_review` state |
| GAP-11 | DAG cascade triggers on report, not review approval                                     | High     | Open — **Mission-6 T3** will move cascade to `createReview(approved)` |
| GAP-12 | `create_review` has no `decision` field                                                 | High     | Open — **Mission-6 T3** will add `approved\|rejected\|revision_needed` |
| GAP-13 | No revision loop (`in_review → working`) or `revisionCount` tracking                   | Medium   | Open — **Mission-6 T3** will implement |

### 6.3 Recommendations

1. **Immediate (next task):** Write E2E tests for all 14 entity invariant gaps. These are pure policy tests — no LLM or transport needed.
2. **Short-term:** Implement FSM guards (GAP-1, GAP-4, GAP-5, GAP-9) to enforce the Registry's declared transitions.
3. **Medium-term:** Address GAP-7 (`thread_converged` polling backup) and GAP-8 (RBAC enforcement).
4. **Deferred:** Agent behavior invariants (INV-SYS-011 through INV-SYS-017) require LLM integration testing — scope for a separate mission.
