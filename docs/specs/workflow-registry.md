## 1. Entity FSM Declarations

### 1.1 Task

```
Entity: Task
States: pending, blocked, working, input_required, in_review, completed, failed, escalated, cancelled
Initial: pending (no dependencies) | blocked (with dependsOn)
Terminal: completed, failed, escalated, cancelled
Additional fields:
  revisionCount      — integer, default 0
  assignedEngineerId — engineerId of the Agent that claimed the Task via get_task; null until claimed
  labels             — Record<string, string>; Mission-19 routing metadata inherited from the creator's Agent at submit-time
```

#### Transitions

| From             | To              | Trigger                                                    | Actor     |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| (initial)        | pending         | `create_task` (no dependsOn)                               | Architect |
| (initial)        | blocked         | `create_task` (with dependsOn)                             | Architect |
| pending          | working         | `get_task` (atomic assignment)                             | Engineer  |
| pending          | cancelled       | `cancel_task`                                              | Architect |
| blocked          | pending         | All dependencies review-approved (cascade)                 | System    |
| blocked          | cancelled       | Any dependency cancelled (cascade)                         | System    |
| working          | in_review       | `create_report`                                            | Engineer  |
| working          | input_required  | `create_clarification`                                     | Engineer  |
| input_required   | working         | `resolve_clarification`                                    | Architect |
| in_review        | completed       | `create_review(decision: "approved")` — triggers DAG cascade | Architect |
| in_review        | working         | `create_review(decision: "rejected")` — increments revisionCount | Architect |
| in_review        | escalated       | `create_review(decision: "rejected")` when revisionCount >= 3 | System |

**Note:** The `working → completed` and `working → failed` transitions from v1.0.0 are removed. Reports now transition to `in_review`, and only an approved review transitions to `completed`. DAG cascades (`unblockDependents`) trigger on `completed`, not on `in_review`.

#### Report Versioning

Reports and reviews use versioned naming based on `revisionCount`:
- First report: `reports/{taskId}-v1-report.md`
- After rejection and re-report: `reports/{taskId}-v2-report.md`
- Formula: `v{revisionCount + 1}`

| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| INV-T1  | A task can only be picked up by one engineer (atomic `getNextDirective`)          | `e2e-chaos.test.ts` "only one engineer" |
| INV-T2  | A blocked task is never returned by `get_task`                                   | `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "completing parent unblocks" |
| INV-T3  | Only pending tasks can be cancelled via `cancel_task`                            | `policy-router.test.ts` "cancelTask cancels" |
| INV-T4  | completed, failed, escalated, cancelled are terminal — no outbound transitions   | `e2e-fsm-enforcement.test.ts` "completed is terminal"; `hub/test/e2e/invariants/INV-T4.test.ts` (mission-41 Wave 2 — all 4 terminals) |
| INV-T5  | Idempotency keys prevent duplicate task creation                                 | `e2e-chaos.test.ts` "duplicate idempotency" |
| INV-T6  | `dependsOn` references must point to existing tasks                              | `policy-router.test.ts` "validates dependsOn" |
| INV-T7  | A task with `dependsOn` starts in `blocked`, not `pending`                       | `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "completing parent" |
| INV-T8  | Only `working` tasks can receive reports (`create_report`)                        | `e2e-fsm-enforcement.test.ts` "rejects report on pending" |
| INV-T9  | DAG cascade (unblockDependents) triggers on review approval, not report submission | NONE |
| INV-T10 | `in_review → working` (rejected) increments `revisionCount`                      | NONE |
| INV-T11 | `revisionCount >= 3` on rejection triggers `escalated` (circuit breaker)         | NONE |
| INV-T12 | `escalated` is locked — `create_report` is rejected from this state              | NONE |
| INV-T13 | A Task's `labels` are set at `create_task` from the caller Agent's labels and are immutable for the life of the Task | `test/mission-19/labels.test.ts` "task inherits creator labels" |
| INV-T14 | `get_task` only returns a Task when `taskClaimableBy(task.labels, claimant.labels)` holds — the claimant's labels must cover every key/value in the Task's labels | `test/mission-19/claim.test.ts` "claim rejected when labels missing" |
| INV-T15 | On successful claim, `get_task` records `task.assignedEngineerId = claimant.engineerId`                     | `test/mission-19/claim.test.ts` "claim persists assignedEngineerId" |
| INV-T16 | Tasks scaffolded from a Proposal inherit the parent Proposal's labels (not the approver's labels)           | `test/mission-19/labels.test.ts` "scaffold inherits proposal labels" |
| INV-T17 | Tasks spawned from a converged Thread's `convergenceAction` inherit the Thread's labels                     | `test/mission-19/labels.test.ts` "thread-spawn inherits thread labels" |

**Resolved gaps:**
- ~~GAP-1~~: `isValidTransition()` is now called in all Task, Idea, Mission, Turn policy handlers (resolved in task-107).
- ~~GAP-9~~: Terminal states are now enforced via FSM guards (resolved in task-107).

| INV-P6   | Scaffolded child Tasks use the Proposal's `labels`, never the approver's — so a Director-role approver cannot redirect the pool | `test/mission-19/labels.test.ts` "scaffold inherits proposal labels" |

~~**Gap: `under_review` phantom state — RESOLVED (task-107): removed from enum.**~~

**Gap (GAP-5):** `reviewProposal` in the store has no status guard — a proposal could theoretically be reviewed multiple times, overwriting previous decisions. The Registry specifies that only `submitted` proposals should be reviewable.

| INV-TH4  | `thread_message` targets the other participants, not the opposite role in the abstract (see INV-TH16; legacy text said "opposite role" before participant-scoped routing shipped) | `threads-2-smoke.test.ts` WF-TH-10, WF-TH-11 |
| INV-TH5  | `thread_converged` and `thread_convergence_completed` target participants (see INV-TH16); Phase 2 merges these into `thread_convergence_finalized` (INV-TH18–19) | `threads-2-smoke.test.ts` WF-TH-05, WF-TH-12 |

| **INV-TH14** | **Participant upsert is symmetric: any reply by `{role, agentId}` not already in `participants[]` appends; existing entries update `lastActiveAt`.

| **INV-TH16** *(ratified, live)* | **Thread dispatches (`thread_message`, `thread_converged`, `thread_convergence_completed`) are participant-scoped via `Selector.engineerIds` derived from `participants[]` (excluding the author on replies).

Ratified in thread-125 with live prod evidence from thread-122/123/124 showing zero architect audit entries on pure engineer↔engineer threads.** | `wave3b-policies.test.ts` "participant-scoped dispatch"; `threads-2-smoke.test.ts` WF-TH-10, WF-TH-11 |
| **INV-TH17** *(ratified, live)* | **Reply turn is pinned by `currentTurnAgentId` in addition to `currentTurn` role.

| **INV-TH19** *(P2 spec, ratified thread-125)* | **Cascade atomicity via validate-then-execute at the gate: every staged action's validator runs before `staged→committed` promotion; any validator failure rejects the whole convergence, leaves thread `active`, no rollback. Post-gate execute-phase infrastructure failures route the thread to `cascade_failed` terminal (high-priority alert), never revert committed state.** | `hub/test/e2e/invariants/INV-TH19.test.ts` (mission-41 Wave 2 — atomicity critical path: mixed valid+invalid rejected with VALID NOT partially spawned) |
| **INV-TH20** *(P2 spec, ratified thread-125)* | **Idempotency key for cascade action execution is the natural `{sourceThreadId, sourceActionId}` pair. Cascade handler checks for an existing entity with this pair before create; if found, skip, audit `action_already_executed`, mark in `ConvergenceReport`. No client-supplied idempotency key required.** | TBD — `M-Phase2-Impl` |
| **INV-TH21** *(P2 spec, ratified thread-125)* | **Thread expiry: any thread in `active` status with `now - updatedAt > thread.idleExpiryMs` (default 7 days, deployment-configurable) is reaped by a periodic Hub task (~1h cadence) and transitioned to `abandoned` with audit action `thread_reaper_abandoned`. Distinguishes from participant-initiated `leave_thread` in audit/metrics.** | TBD — `M-Phase2-Impl` |
| **INV-TH22** *(P2 spec, ratified thread-125)* | **`StagedAction.proposer` carries `{role, agentId}` rather than role alone. Essential for audit/provenance in P2P threads where multiple agents share a role (engineer↔engineer).** | TBD — `M-Phase2-Impl` |
| **INV-TH23** *(P2 spec, ratified thread-125; Summary-as-Living-Record)* | **Every entity spawned by the cascade carries first-class metadata `sourceThreadId`, `sourceActionId`, and `sourceThreadSummary` (the `Thread.summary` frozen at the moment of commit). The consensus narrative is preserved immutably on the spawned entity even if the source thread is later archived.** | TBD — `M-Phase2-Impl` |

**Phase 1 vocabulary (live):** `StagedActionType = "close_no_action"` only. Phase 2 ratified (spec, awaiting `M-Phase2-Impl`): `close_no_action | create_task | create_proposal | create_idea | update_idea | update_mission_status | propose_mission | create_clarification` as autonomous-via-convergence actions. Director-gated (scope-widening, never autonomous): `create_mission | update_mission_scope | cancel_task`. Scope-of-commitment principle: actions widening authorization scope require Director; actions within existing scope are autonomous.

**Phase 2 additions (spec, awaiting `M-Phase2-Impl`):** `leave_thread` tool (participant-only; thread → `abandoned`; auto-retracts leaver's staged actions); `list_available_peers(role?, matchLabels?)` discovery tool (returns `{agentId, role, labels}`); `thread_convergence_finalized` merged event superseding `thread_converged` + `thread_convergence_completed` (carries full `ConvergenceReport`); Director first-class participation with reserved `director-*` agentId prefix and chat-injection notification surface.

**Removed in 2.0 cutover:** singular `convergenceAction` field, `setConvergenceAction` store method, old `handleThreadConvergedWithAction` single-type branch. Pre-cutover threads in non-terminal states were admin-closed. See ADR-013.

**Former INV-TH10** (Entities auto-spawned by `convergenceAction` inherit labels) is subsumed by INV-TH23 (Summary-as-Living-Record) and the Phase 2 per-action cascade; retired.

**Former gap** (`escalated` phantom state): retained in the `ThreadStatus` enum for backwards compatibility but not emitted by any store code. Candidate for removal during `M-Phase3-Polish` legacy sweep.

**Provenance** for INV-TH16 through INV-TH23: ratified in thread-125 (2026-04-18) between greg (engineer, `eng-0d2c690e7dd5`) and architect (`eng-ddec09b296d0`); 8 rounds; full architectural record frozen in `thread-125.summary` per INV-TH23. See ADR-014 for the canonical design document.

**Gap: No FSM enforcement. Any status can transition to any other status. The Registry recommends adding guards: `dismissed` should be terminal (or require explicit re-opening), `incorporated` should only be reachable when `missionId` is set.**

### 1.5 Mission

### 1.10 Agent (M18 + Mission-19 + ADR-017)

```
Entity: Agent
States (livenessState FSM — ADR-017): online, degraded, unresponsive, offline
Initial: online (on first register_role handshake)
Terminal: (none — archival via `archived` flag, not deletion)
Identity: engineerId (Hub-issued) — stable across reconnects
          fingerprint = sha256(globalInstanceId) — carried by the proxy
          sessionEpoch — monotonic; incremented on each displacement
          currentSessionId — ephemeral, set per SSE connection
Routing fields:
  role          — "engineer" | "architect" | "director"
  labels        — Record<string, string>; Kubernetes-style routing metadata, IMMUTABLE post-create in v1
Liveness fields (ADR-017):
  wakeEndpoint  — optional HTTP URL Hub POSTs to on queue-deadline miss (Cloud Run cold-start)
  lastHeartbeatAt — updated on every drain_pending_actions call; drives FSM transitions
  receiptSla    — ms; default 30000; per-agent override via register_role
```

Agents are the first-class routing targets in Mission-19. Every dispatched event resolves a `Selector` (roles ∧ matchLabels ∧ optional engineerId pin) against the live Agent registry — there are no role-wide broadcasts once labels are in use.

#### Reserved Label Keys

| Key                 | Semantics                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ois.io/namespace`  | Reserved for a future strict-isolation tenant boundary. No special v1 behavior — stored verbatim; treated like any other label. |

Keys prefixed with `ois.io/` are reserved for future Hub-defined routing semantics. Caller-supplied labels under this prefix are currently accepted and stored but may acquire special handling in later missions.

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| INV-AG1  | An Agent's `labels` are set at first `register_role` and cannot be changed by later handshakes (displacing calls preserve the original set) | `test/mission-19/registry.test.ts` "labels preserved on displacement" |
| INV-AG2  | Agent identity is `engineerId` (Hub-issued, stable). `currentSessionId` is ephemeral and MUST NOT be used for P2P routing | `test/mission-19/registry.test.ts` "P2P via engineerId" |
| INV-AG3  | An Agent with empty `labels = {}` matches any Selector whose `matchLabels` is also empty or absent; it does NOT match a Selector that requires specific labels | `test/mission-19/selector.test.ts` "empty labels match empty selectors" |
| INV-AG4  | A pre-Mission-19 Agent persisted without a `labels` field is defensively migrated to `labels = {}` on read | `test/mission-19/registry.test.ts` "legacy agents default to empty labels" |
| INV-AG5  | `register_role` may optionally declare `labels`. On first create, they persist. On displacement, the persisted labels are preserved verbatim (ignore incoming) | `test/mission-19/registry.test.ts` "displacement ignores incoming labels" |
| INV-AG6  | Agent `livenessState == "online"` requires `now - lastHeartbeatAt ≤ 2× receiptSla`. FSM transitions are Hub-enforced; raw socket state is NOT authoritative. Demotion `online → degraded → unresponsive → offline` is automatic (ADR-017) | `test/e2e/comms-reliability.test.ts` "liveness FSM demotes on stale heartbeat" |
| INV-AG7  | `wakeEndpoint`, when declared at `register_role`, enables durable Hub-to-agent wake on queue-deadline miss (ADR-017). Absence of `wakeEndpoint` means watchdog cannot re-dispatch; escalation skips Stage 1 and proceeds directly to Director notification | `test/e2e/comms-reliability.test.ts` "wakeEndpoint cold-starts scaled-to-zero agent" |

---

### 1.11 PendingActionItem (ADR-017)

```
Entity: PendingActionItem
States: enqueued, receipt_acked, completion_acked, escalated, errored
Initial: enqueued (on dispatch of owed-response event)
Terminal: completion_acked (happy path) | escalated (Director handoff) | errored (non-recoverable)
Identity: id (Hub-issued, e.g. "pa-2026-04-19T02-25-08-abc123")
Natural key: `${targetAgentId}:${entityRef}:${dispatchType}` — idempotency guard
Durability: GCS-backed; survives Hub and agent restarts
```

PendingActionItem is the authoritative record of work owed to a specific agent. Every dispatched event that expects an agent response enqueues a PendingActionItem **before** SSE fires (INV-COMMS-L01). SSE is a delivery hint; the queue is truth.

| receipt_acked    | completion_acked   | Agent settles owed work with `sourceQueueItemId` reference (e.g., `create_thread_reply`, `auto_review`) |
| enqueued         | escalated          | Receipt deadline missed 3+ times; watchdog escalates to Director notification |
| receipt_acked    | escalated          | Completion deadline missed; agent alive but stuck |

---

### 1.12 DirectorNotification (ADR-017)

```
Entity: DirectorNotification
States: unacknowledged, acknowledged
Initial: unacknowledged (on creation)
Terminal: acknowledged (via `acknowledge_director_notification` tool)
Identity: id (Hub-issued, e.g. "dn-2026-04-19-001")
Durability: GCS-backed
Severity: info | warning | critical
```

DirectorNotification is the terminal escalation surface. When the watchdog escalates a PendingActionItem (agent unresponsive or stuck), a notification is persisted here. The Director-chat layer consumes from this store via a future chat-side surface; for now, Director queries directly via `list_director_notifications`.

## 2. Multi-Actor Workflow Declarations

### WF-001 Task Happy Path

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer
Precondition: None
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                          | State After  | Dispatch Selector                                                  |
| ---- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Architect | `create_task(title, description)`               | pending      | `task_issued` → { roles: [engineer], matchLabels: task.labels } |
| 2    | Engineer  | `get_task()`                                    | working      | `directive_acknowledged` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: task.labels } |
| 3    | Engineer  | `create_report(taskId, ...)`                    | in_review    | `report_submitted` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: task.labels } |
| 4    | Architect | `create_review(taskId, ..., decision: "approved")` | completed  | `review_completed` → { engineerId: task.assignedEngineerId } (P2P; label-scoped pool fallback if null) |

Step 1: `task.labels` are inherited from the caller Architect's Agent at submit-time (INV-T13). All downstream dispatches filter to Agents whose `labels` cover those keys (INV-AG3).
Step 2: `get_task` applies claim enforcement — only Agents whose `labels` are a superset of `task.labels` see the Task (INV-T14). `task.assignedEngineerId` is recorded (INV-T15).
Step 3 transitions to `in_review` (not `completed`). No DAG cascade fires at this point.
Step 4 transitions to `completed` and triggers DAG cascade (`unblockDependents`) if dependents exist. `review_completed` routes P2P to the original claimant via `assignedEngineerId` so the same Engineer instance that did the work sees the approval — even if other Agents share the label scope.

**Agent behavior:** Step 4 is automated — the Architect's `sandwichReviewReport` handler fires on `report_submitted`, reads the report from GCS, uses LLM to evaluate, and calls `create_review` with `decision: "approved"`.

**Tested By:** NONE (existing tests use old semantics — will be updated in Mission-6 T5)

### WF-001a Task Revision Loop

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer
Precondition: Task in working state
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                           | State After  | Dispatch Selector                                          |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Engineer  | `create_report(taskId, ...)`                     | in_review    | `report_submitted` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: task.labels } |
| 2    | Architect | `create_review(taskId, ..., decision: "rejected")` | working    | `revision_required` → { engineerId: task.assignedEngineerId } (P2P; label-scoped pool fallback) |
| 3    | Engineer  | Reads feedback, revises work                     | working      | (none)                                                    |
| 4    | Engineer  | `create_report(taskId, ...)`                     | in_review    | `report_submitted` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: task.labels } |
| 5    | Architect | `create_review(taskId, ..., decision: "approved")` | completed  | `review_completed` → { engineerId: task.assignedEngineerId } (P2P; label-scoped pool fallback) |

Step 2 increments `revisionCount` and emits `revision_required` with `previousReportRef` and `reviewRef`.
Step 4 generates a versioned report name: `reports/{taskId}-v{revisionCount+1}-report.md`.

**Agent behavior:** Step 2 is automated — `sandwichReviewReport` evaluates the report and may reject with specific feedback. Step 3 requires the Engineer Plugin to surface the `revision_required` event as an actionable prompt.

**Tested By:** NONE (new workflow — will be tested in Mission-6 T5)

---

### WF-001b Task Escalation (Circuit Breaker)

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer, System
Precondition: Task has been rejected 3+ times (revisionCount >= 3)
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                           | State After  | Dispatch Selector                                         |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Engineer  | `create_report(taskId, ...)`                     | in_review    | `report_submitted` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: task.labels } |
| 2    | Architect | `create_review(taskId, ..., decision: "rejected")` | escalated  | `director_attention_required` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: task.labels } |

Step 2: when `revisionCount >= 3`, the system transitions to `escalated` instead of `working`. The `escalated` state is locked — no outbound transitions. The Engineer cannot submit further reports. Requires future Director intervention (e.g., `reset_task` tool).

**Tested By:** NONE (new workflow — will be tested in Mission-6 T5)

### WF-002 Task with Clarification

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer
Precondition: Task exists in working state
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                              | State After     | Dispatch Selector                                                                            |
| ---- | --------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Engineer  | `create_clarification(taskId, q)`   | input_required  | `clarification_requested` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: task.labels }                 |
| 2    | Architect | `resolve_clarification(taskId, a)`  | working         | `clarification_answered` → { engineerId: task.assignedEngineerId } (P2P; label-scoped pool fallback) |
| 3    | Engineer  | `get_clarification(taskId)`         | working         | (none)                                                                                       |

**Agent behavior:** Step 2 is automated — the Architect's `sandwichClarification` handler fires on `clarification_requested`, uses LLM to answer, and calls `resolve_clarification`.

**Tested By:** `e2e-foundation.test.ts` "working → input_required → working state transitions"

### WF-003 Task DAG — Dependency Unblocking

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer, System
Precondition: Two or more tasks with dependency relationships
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                              | State After  | Dispatch Selector                                      |
| ---- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Architect | `create_task("A", ...)`                             | A: pending   | `task_issued` → { roles: [engineer], matchLabels: A.labels } |
| 2    | Architect | `create_task("B", ..., dependsOn: ["A"])`           | B: blocked   | `task_blocked` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: B.labels } |
| 3    | Engineer  | `get_task()` → picks up A                           | A: working   | `directive_acknowledged` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: A.labels } |
| 4    | Engineer  | `create_report("A", ...)`                           | A: in_review | `report_submitted` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: A.labels } |
| 5    | Architect | `create_review("A", ..., decision: "approved")`     | A: completed | `review_completed` → { engineerId: A.assignedEngineerId } (P2P) |
| 6    | System    | Cascade: unblockDependents(A)                       | B: pending   | `task_issued` → { roles: [engineer], matchLabels: B.labels } |
| 7    | Engineer  | `get_task()` → picks up B                           | B: working   | `directive_acknowledged` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: B.labels } |

**Key change (v2.0.0):** Cascade unblocking now happens at Step 6 (after review approval), not at Step 4 (after report). This prevents unblocking dependents before the Architect has verified the work.

**Tested By:** NONE (existing tests use old semantics — will be updated in Mission-6 T5)

### WF-003a Task DAG — Cancel Cascade

| 2    | System    | Cascade: cancelDependents(A)                  | B: cancelled  | `task_cancelled` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: B.labels } |

| 2    | Architect | `create_proposal_review(id, decision, fb)` | approved          | `proposal_decided` → { roles: [engineer], matchLabels: proposal.labels } |
| 3    | Engineer  | `close_proposal(id)`                       | implemented       | (none)                                                           |

**Agent behavior:** Step 2 is automated — the Architect's `sandwichReviewProposal` handler fires on `proposal_submitted`.
**Label inheritance:** When the review scaffolds child Tasks (via `ProposedExecutionPlan`), each scaffolded Task is created with `proposal.labels`, not the approver's labels (INV-P6, INV-T16). A Director-role approver outside the original label scope cannot accidentally redirect implementation to a different pool.

**Tested By:** `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "create → changes_requested → resubmit → approve → close"

### WF-004a Proposal with Changes Requested

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer
Precondition: None
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                           | State After         | Event Emitted                       |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |

| 2    | Architect | `create_proposal_review(id, "changes_requested", fb)` | changes_requested | `proposal_decided` → [engineer]  |
| 3    | Engineer  | `create_proposal(title_v2, summary_v2, body_v2)` | new: submitted      | `proposal_submitted` → [architect]  |
| 4    | Architect | `create_proposal_review(id_v2, "approved", fb)`  | new: approved       | `proposal_decided` → [engineer]     |
| 5    | Engineer  | `close_proposal(id_v2)`                          | new: implemented    | (none)                              |

**Note:** There is no "update proposal" operation. The Engineer creates a new proposal. The original remains in `changes_requested` state permanently.

**Tested By:** `e2e-workflows.test.ts` "create → changes_requested → resubmit → approve → close"

### WF-004b Proposal Rejection

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer

### WF-005 Thread Happy Path — Convergence

```
Actors: Architect, Engineer
Precondition: None
```

| Step | Actor     | Action                                                        | State After | Dispatch Selector                                                  |
| ---- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Any       | `create_thread(title, message)`                               | active      | `thread_message` → { roles: [other role], matchLabels: thread.labels } |
| 2    | Other     | `create_thread_reply(id, msg, converged: true)`               | active      | `thread_message` → { roles: [initiator role], matchLabels: thread.labels } |
| 3    | Initiator | `create_thread_reply(id, msg, converged: true)`               | converged   | `thread_converged` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: thread.labels } |

**Agent behavior:** Step 3's `thread_converged` event triggers one of two mutually exclusive paths:

- **Path A (WF-005b):** If a `convergenceAction` was attached to the thread, the Hub cascade handles it deterministically — no Architect LLM involvement.
- **Path B (WF-005a):** If no `convergenceAction` exists, the Architect LLM receives the `thread_converged` event (with `hasAction: false`) and autonomously decides what action to take.

The `hasAction` flag in the `thread_converged` event payload prevents both paths from firing simultaneously (see INV-SYS-018).

**Tested By:** `e2e-foundation.test.ts` "both parties converge → thread status = converged"

### WF-005a Thread — Convergence to Auto-Directive (Architect LLM Path)

```
Actors: Architect (automated), Engineer
Precondition: Thread converged WITHOUT a convergenceAction (hasAction = false)
```

| Step | Actor           | Action                                               | State After          | Event Emitted                     |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1    | System          | `thread_converged` event fires (hasAction: false)    | thread: converged    | `thread_converged` → [architect]  |
| 2    | Architect (LLM) | `sandwichThreadConverged` reads thread, LLM reasons  | —                    | —                                 |
| 3    | Architect (LLM) | If `implementation_ready`: `create_task(title, desc, sourceThreadId)` | task: pending | `task_issued` → [engineer] |
| 4    | System          | Thread auto-closed by sourceThreadId (XD-005)        | thread: closed       | —                                 |

**Guard:** `sandwichThreadConverged` checks thread status before acting — if the thread is already `closed` (e.g. Hub cascade beat the event loop), it skips processing.

**Tested By:** NONE (requires LLM integration — not testable in-memory)

**Note:** This is the only workflow where the Architect autonomously creates tasks without Director instruction.

### WF-005b Thread — Convergence via Hub Cascade (convergenceAction Path)

```
Actors: System (Hub policy engine)
Precondition: Thread converged WITH a convergenceAction attached
```

| Step | Actor  | Action                                                                      | State After       | Dispatch Selector                                             |
| ---- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Any    | `create_thread_reply(converged: true, convergenceAction: {type, template})` | converged         | internal: `thread_converged_with_action`                      |
| 2    | Hub    | `handleThreadConvergedWithAction` reads action type                         | —                 | —                                                             |
| 3a   | Hub    | If `create_task`: `submitDirective(description, labels: thread.labels)`     | task: pending     | `task_issued` → { roles: [engineer], matchLabels: thread.labels } |
| 3b   | Hub    | If `create_proposal`: `submitProposal(title, description, labels: thread.labels)` | proposal: submitted | `proposal_submitted` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: thread.labels } |
| 4    | Hub    | `closeThread(threadId)`                                                     | thread: closed    | —                                                             |
| 5    | System | `thread_converged` SSE emitted (hasAction: true)                            | —                 | `thread_converged` → { roles: [architect], matchLabels: thread.labels } |

**Label inheritance:** The spawned Task or Proposal inherits the Thread's labels — NOT the converging party's labels (INV-T17, INV-TH10). This lets a Director-role Agent mediate a conversation between two domain-scoped Engineers/Architects without rewriting the downstream routing scope.

**Dedup:** Step 5 emits the SSE event with `hasAction: true`. The Architect's notification handler skips `sandwichThreadConverged` when this flag is set, preventing duplicate task/proposal creation. The event-loop polling backup is also guarded — `sandwichThreadConverged` re-reads the thread and skips if status is already `closed`.

**Key difference from WF-005a:** This path is deterministic and Hub-driven. The action is pre-declared via `convergenceAction` (late-binding) — no LLM reasoning required. The converging party specifies exactly what should happen on convergence.

**Tested By:** NONE (requires integration test with convergenceAction)

| 3    | Architect | `update_mission(id, status: "completed")`        | completed   | (none — no event for completion)            |

| ---- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Architect       | `get_pending_actions()`                   | Discovers all outstanding work            |
| 2    | Architect (LLM) | Process `unreviewedTasks`                 | Calls `sandwichReviewReport` per task     |
| 3    | Architect (LLM) | Process `pendingProposals`                | Calls `sandwichReviewProposal` per proposal |
| 4    | Architect (LLM) | Process `threadsAwaitingReply`            | Calls `sandwichThreadReply` per thread    |
| 5    | Architect (LLM) | Process `clarificationsPending`           | Calls `sandwichClarification` per task    |
| 6    | Architect (LLM) | Process `convergedThreads`                | Calls `sandwichThreadConverged` per thread (guarded — skips if thread already closed by Hub cascade) |

**Dedup note:** Step 6 is a polling backup for `thread_converged` SSE events. The `sandwichThreadConverged` handler re-reads the thread and skips if status is `closed`, preventing duplicates when the Hub cascade (WF-005b) already handled the convergence.

**Tested By:** NONE (agent-side, requires LLM)

| Mechanism   | `task.correlationId` stored on the Task; `mission.tasks` computed on read from the task store filtered by that field. |
| Failure     | None — no link step to fail. Setting `correlationId` is atomic with task creation. |
| Tested By   | `mission-integrity.test.ts` (concurrent create_task) + `e2e-workflows.test.ts` |

## 4. SSE Event Catalogue

Since Mission-19 (v2.1.0), all events in this catalogue are delivered via `ctx.dispatch(event, data, selector)` — the Hub resolves the Selector against the live Agent registry and SSE-pushes to every matching Agent. The "Target" column below is shorthand for the Selector: `[role]` means `{ roles: [role], matchLabels: <entity>.labels }` where `<entity>` is the Task/Proposal/Thread whose lifecycle event this is. Entries marked **P2P** pin to a specific `engineerId` (with a label-scoped pool fallback when the pin is unavailable). See §6 for the routing model.

### 4.1 Task Domain Events

| Event                    | Emitter                         | Target          | Payload                                         | Purpose                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `task_issued`       | TaskPolicy.createTask           | [engineer] ∧ task.labels | taskId, directive, correlationId, sourceThreadId  | New task available for pickup within the Task's label scope |
| `task_issued`       | TaskPolicy.handleTaskCompleted  | [engineer] ∧ task.labels | taskId, directive, correlationId                  | Blocked task unblocked by cascade     |
| `task_blocked`           | TaskPolicy.createTask           | [architect] ∧ task.labels | taskId, directive, correlationId, dependsOn       | Task created but waiting on deps      |
| `directive_acknowledged` | TaskPolicy.getTask              | [architect] ∧ task.labels | taskId, engineerId, directive                     | Engineer picked up task               |
| `report_submitted`       | TaskPolicy.createReport         | [architect] ∧ task.labels | taskId, summary, reportRef                        | Engineer completed work               |
| `task_cancelled`         | TaskPolicy.handleTaskCancelled  | [architect] ∧ task.labels | taskId, reason                                    | Dependent task cascade-cancelled      |

### 4.2 Clarification Events

| Event                      | Emitter                                   | Target                                  | Payload            | Purpose                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `clarification_requested`  | ClarificationPolicy.createClarification   | [architect] ∧ task.labels               | taskId, question   | Engineer needs guidance           |
| `clarification_answered`   | ClarificationPolicy.resolveClarification  | **P2P** task.assignedEngineerId (fallback: [engineer] ∧ task.labels) | taskId, answer     | Architect responded — routes back to the exact Agent instance that asked |

### 4.3 Review Events

| Event                        | Emitter                   | Target                                                 | Payload                                              | Purpose                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

### Label/Selector Invariants (Mission-19)

| ID          | Invariant                                                                                                    | Tested By                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| INV-SYS-L01 | Every dispatch resolves a `Selector` — there are no unscoped, role-only broadcasts in policy handlers        | `test/mission-19/selector.test.ts` "no role-only broadcasts" |
| INV-SYS-L02 | `labelsMatch(agent.labels, selector.matchLabels)` is AND-equality: every `(k, v)` in `matchLabels` must appear verbatim in `agent.labels`; a missing key on the Agent is a miss | `test/mission-19/selector.test.ts` "matchLabels is AND-equality" |
| INV-SYS-L03 | `selector.roles` is OR-across-roles but ANDs with `matchLabels` (an Agent must match the role set AND the label set) | `test/mission-19/selector.test.ts` "roles OR, combined with matchLabels AND" |
| INV-SYS-L04 | `selector.engineerId`, when set, pins dispatch to that specific Agent regardless of other filters            | `test/mission-19/selector.test.ts` "engineerId pin overrides pool" |
| INV-SYS-L05 | P2P dispatch with a stale or offline `engineerId` delivers to zero Agents — callers MUST provide a label-scoped fallback for availability | `test/mission-19/p2p.test.ts` "stale engineerId falls through to fallback" |
| INV-SYS-L06 | Entity labels are write-once: set at create-time from the caller Agent's labels (or inherited from parent entity) and never mutated by later operations on the entity | `test/mission-19/labels.test.ts` "entity labels immutable" |
| INV-SYS-L07 | An Agent registered without labels (`labels = {}`) CAN claim unlabeled Tasks but CANNOT claim any Task with non-empty labels | `test/mission-19/claim.test.ts` "unlabeled agent blocked from labeled tasks" |
| INV-SYS-L08 | Label inheritance is authoritative — scaffolded children read labels from the parent entity's record, not from the approver/converging Agent's session | `test/mission-19/labels.test.ts` "scaffold + thread-spawn inherit parent labels" |
| INV-SYS-L09 | If zero Agents match a selector, dispatch is a no-op for SSE — the webhook fallback (when configured) is the only at-least-once delivery path | `test/mission-19/dispatch.test.ts` "empty match → webhook fallback" |
| INV-SYS-L10 | Persisted notifications retain the flattened `targetRoles` field for backward compatibility with the catch-up polling endpoint; selectors are NOT replayed | N/A (transport compatibility, not behavioral) |

### Comms Reliability Invariants (ADR-017)

These invariants supersede INV-SYS-010 ("SSE delivery is at-least-once; clients must handle idempotency"). Post-ADR-017, SSE is a delivery hint — the PendingActionItem queue is the authoritative at-least-once delivery mechanism, and Hub-side watchdog enforces liveness guarantees. INV-SYS-016 (polling-as-SSE-backup) is subsumed by the drain protocol below.

| ID             | Invariant                                                                                                    | Tested By                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| INV-COMMS-L01  | Every dispatched event that owes a specific agent a response MUST be durably enqueued on that agent's pending-actions queue **before** SSE fires. Enqueue is transactional with the originating state change | `test/e2e/comms-reliability.test.ts` "enqueue precedes SSE" |
| INV-COMMS-L02  | Every queue item has both `receiptDeadline` and `completionDeadline`. Watchdog MUST enforce both. No infinite-deadline items are permitted | `test/e2e/comms-reliability.test.ts` "watchdog enforces deadlines" |
| INV-COMMS-L03  | Agent `livenessState == "online"` requires `now - lastHeartbeatAt ≤ 2× receiptSla`. The Hub MUST NOT report `online` for agents failing this check; FSM transitions automatically (supersedes stale-socket-truth pattern) | `test/e2e/comms-reliability.test.ts` "liveness reflects heartbeat reality" |
| INV-COMMS-L04  | Every queue item reaches a terminal state (`completion_acked` \| `escalated` \| `errored`). No item may remain non-terminal beyond `completionDeadline + maxWatchdogWindow`. **No silent drops — ever** | `test/e2e/comms-reliability.test.ts` "no silent drops" |
| INV-COMMS-L05  | Escalation ladder is deterministic and auditable: re-dispatch (+ durable wake if `wakeEndpoint` present) → demote liveness → Director notification. Every stage writes an audit entry with queue-item ID | `test/e2e/comms-reliability.test.ts` "escalation ladder auditable" |

## 6. Label/Selector Routing

Mission-19 added a Kubernetes-style label/selector model for routing events and claim work across heterogeneous Agent populations. This section is authoritative for all routing semantics.

### 6.1 Model

An **Agent** is registered with:
- `role` — one of `engineer`, `architect`, `director` (used for authorization; also usable in selectors)
- `labels` — a flat `Record<string, string>` of routing metadata

A **Selector** is an object `{ engineerId?, roles?, matchLabels? }`:

```ts
interface Selector {
  engineerId?: string;                   // pin to one Agent
  roles?: ("engineer"|"architect"|"director")[]; // OR across roles
  matchLabels?: Record<string, string>;  // AND-equality subset check on agent.labels
}
```

An Agent `a` matches selector `s` iff **all** of the following hold:
- `s.engineerId === undefined` OR `a.engineerId === s.engineerId`
- `s.roles === undefined` OR `a.role ∈ s.roles`
- For every `(k, v) ∈ (s.matchLabels ?? {})`, `a.labels[k] === v`

Empty / missing fields are *no-ops* — an absent filter does not restrict. An empty selector `{}` matches every online Agent.

### 6.2 Dispatch Surface

Policy handlers call `ctx.dispatch(event, data, selector)`. The Hub:

1. Persists the notification with the flattened `targetRoles` for catch-up (INV-SYS-L10).
2. Resolves `selector` against the live Agent registry (`selectAgents(selector)`).
3. Sends the SSE frame to every matched Agent's `currentSessionId`.
4. If zero matches AND a webhook URL is configured, fires the webhook as fallback (INV-SYS-L09).

Policy handlers MUST NOT reach into the registry directly — they must go through `ctx.dispatch`.

### 6.3 Label Inheritance Chains

| Source                                         | Destination                         | Rule                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Caller Agent's labels                          | `Task.labels` at `create_task`      | Set at submit-time (INV-T13)                                      |
| Caller Agent's labels                          | `Proposal.labels` at `create_proposal` | Set at submit-time (INV-P5)                                    |
| Opener Agent's labels                          | `Thread.labels` at `create_thread`  | Set at create-time (INV-TH9)                                      |
| `Proposal.labels`                              | Child `Task.labels` on scaffold     | Read from parent Proposal, NOT the approver (INV-P6, INV-T16)     |
| `Thread.labels`                                | Spawned `Task.labels` or `Proposal.labels` on convergence | Read from source Thread, NOT the converging party (INV-T17, INV-TH10) |

### 6.4 Claim Enforcement (`get_task`)

A Task's labels are a *claim gate*, not just a routing hint. `taskClaimableBy(taskLabels, claimantLabels)`:

```
taskKeys = keys(taskLabels)
if taskKeys is empty: return true               // unlabeled Task is open to anyone
if claimantLabels is undefined: return false    // unlabeled Agent cannot claim labeled work
for each (k, v) in taskLabels:
    if claimantLabels[k] !== v: return false
return true
```

`get_task` walks the pending queue and returns the first Task for which `taskClaimableBy(task.labels, claimant.labels)` holds. On a successful claim, `task.assignedEngineerId = claimant.engineerId` is persisted (INV-T15) — this enables P2P routing for subsequent events.

### 6.5 P2P Routing Pattern

Events tied to a specific Agent's work (review outcomes, clarification answers) use a two-tier dispatch:

```ts
await ctx.dispatch(event, data,
  task.assignedEngineerId
    ? { engineerId: task.assignedEngineerId }
    : { roles: [...], matchLabels: task.labels }
);
```

When `assignedEngineerId` is set, the Hub pins to that Agent. If the pin is stale (offline, session expired, agent archived), the selector matches zero Agents and delivery falls through to the webhook (INV-SYS-L05, INV-SYS-L09). Callers requiring at-least-once-to-some-Agent must omit the pin and use `matchLabels` on its own.

### 6.6 Defensive Migration

Entities persisted before v2.1.0 did not carry a `labels` field. Every read path normalizes a missing `labels` to `{}` (empty map). Consequences:
- Legacy Agents match only empty selectors and zero-label Tasks.
- Legacy Tasks are claimable by any Agent (taskKeys is empty → returns true).
- Legacy Proposals/Threads dispatch with `matchLabels: {}` — which imposes no label constraint, so behavior reverts to pre-Mission-19 role-scoped broadcast.

Migration is read-through: no backfill job runs. Newly-created entities always carry labels.

### 6.7 Reserved Keys

| Key                 | Status v2.1.0                         | Future semantics                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ois.io/namespace`  | Stored as-is; no special behavior     | Strict tenant isolation boundary (no cross-namespace dispatch) |
| `ois.io/*` (other)  | Reserved prefix; stored as-is         | Hub-defined routing semantics in later missions    |

Caller-supplied labels under `ois.io/` are accepted but callers are warned (via this spec) that later Hub versions may reinterpret these keys.

| GAP-13 | No revision loop (`in_review → working`) or `revisionCount` tracking                   | Medium   | Open — **Mission-6 T3** will implement |
| GAP-14 | No circuit breaker for infinite revision loops                                          | Medium   | Open — **Mission-6 T4** will implement `escalated` state |
| GAP-15 | Thread convergence dual-execution: Hub cascade and Architect LLM both fire for same thread | High     | **RESOLVED** (idea-57) — `hasAction` flag gates SSE path, status guard gates polling path |
| GAP-16 | No routing model beyond `role` — all `architect` or all `engineer` agents receive every broadcast | High | **RESOLVED** (Mission-19, task-195/196/197) — Kubernetes-style label selectors on every dispatch; claim enforcement on `get_task`; P2P routing via `assignedEngineerId` |
| GAP-17 | No way to pin a reply to the specific Agent instance that produced the work — stale reviews could reach any engineer in the pool | High | **RESOLVED** (Mission-19, t5) — review/clarification events pin to `task.assignedEngineerId` with label-scoped fallback |
| GAP-18 | Entities created at thread convergence or proposal scaffold ignored the parent's routing intent — child was dispatched to the approver/converger's scope | Medium | **RESOLVED** (Mission-19, t3) — authoritative label inheritance reads from parent entity record |

### 6.3 Recommendations

1. **Immediate (next task):** Write E2E tests for all 14 entity invariant gaps. These are pure policy tests — no LLM or transport needed.
2. **Short-term:** Implement FSM guards (GAP-1, GAP-4, GAP-5, GAP-9) to enforce the Registry's declared transitions.
3. **Medium-term:** Write integration tests for convergence dedup (INV-SYS-018) covering both WF-005a and WF-005b paths.
4. **Deferred:** Agent behavior invariants (INV-SYS-011 through INV-SYS-017) require LLM integration testing — scope for a separate mission.
