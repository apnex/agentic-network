# Mission-56 (M-Push-Foundation) Preflight Check

**Mission:** M-Push-Foundation
**Brief:** mission entity description (no separate documentRef; in-entity-brief pattern; Design v1.2 at `docs/designs/m-push-foundation-design.md` is the binding scope source-of-truth)
**Preflight author:** lily / architect
**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Verdict:** **GREEN**
**Freshness:** current (until 2026-05-26)
**Activation status:** READY pending Director release-gate signal `update_mission(mission-56, status="active")` + bundled rename PR sequencing prerequisite (see §Activation gates below)

---

## Category A — Documentation integrity

- **A1.** Brief location: PASS — entity description compactly summarizes mission scope; references Design v1.2 (`docs/designs/m-push-foundation-design.md` commit `cc90174` on main) as binding scope source-of-truth. In-entity-brief pattern matching missions 50/51/52/53/54/55.
- **A2.** Branch sync: PASS — main HEAD `ef633144` (mission-55 PR #65 merge); Design v1.2 + Recon Report + Universal Adapter notification contract spec + cleanup mission closing audit all on main. Two architect-authored doc PRs in flight (PR #66 retrospective + PR #67 calibration #23 doc); these are not blocking the preflight (they're documentary; M-Push-Foundation can preflight against current main state).
- **A3.** Cross-referenced artifacts exist: PASS —
  - `docs/designs/m-push-foundation-design.md` v1.2 ✓ (commit `cc90174`)
  - `docs/designs/m-push-foundational-adapter-recon.md` ✓ (commit `f519f74`)
  - `docs/specs/universal-adapter-notification-contract.md` ✓ (commit `736e13d`)
  - `docs/audits/m-pre-push-adapter-cleanup-closing-report.md` ✓ (commit `ef633144`)
  - `packages/network-adapter/src/{wire,session,mcp-boundary}/` ✓ (current names; rename pending)
  - thread-325 round-2 audit ✓ (closed; converged)
  - `docs/methodology/mission-lifecycle.md` v0.1 ✓ (cited as prime source of truth)

## Category B — Hub filing integrity

- **B1.** Entity correctly filed: PASS — id=mission-56, status=proposed, correlationId=mission-56, sourceThreadId=null, sourceActionId=null (architect-direct create_mission consistent with mission-54 + mission-55 pattern), createdBy.role=system/agentId=hub-system.
- **B2.** Title + description faithful: PASS — title "M-Push-Foundation" matches Design v1.2 + thread-325; description is comprehensive structured brief.
- **B3.** tasks[] + ideas[] empty: PASS — bug-31 bypass technique formally sunset post-mission-51 W5; this mission CAN use plannedTasks if engineer prefers, OR architect-side per-wave T1+ issuance (per autonomous-arc-driving pattern). Engineer-decision at activation. No pre-scaffolded tasks at preflight time per policy.

## Category C — Referenced-artifact currency

- **C1.** File paths cited in brief: PASS — verified above (Design v1.2, Recon Report, spec, closing audit, source dirs, ADR-008, ADR-017, methodology calibrations all currently exist on main or in repo state).
- **C2.** Numeric claims: PASS — sizing L-firm baseline (~6-8 eng-days; 6-bundled wave shape); XL escalation gate (a)+(b) ~9% combined probability per round-2 audit; cold-start soft-cap N=500-1000; seen-id LRU N=1000; poll backstop default cadence 5min. All design choices ratified at Design v1.2 + thread-325; not measurements requiring re-verification.
- **C3.** Cited ideas/bugs/threads/missions in assumed state:
  - mission-51: completed ✓ (W6 explicit deferral being landed)
  - mission-52: completed ✓ (GH-event bridge producer-side; consumed)
  - mission-53: **still `proposed`** — brief states "absorbed". Absorption mechanic is "abandon-with-pointer". **Observation, not blocker:** mission-53 → abandoned flip is mechanical; can be done at M-Push-Foundation activation (architect-side update_mission). No execution dependency.
  - mission-54: completed ✓ (recon predecessor; Q1/Q2/Q10 outcomes locked at Design v1.2)
  - mission-55: completed ✓ (cleanup predecessor; 10 deliverables shipped + Universal Adapter notification contract on main)
  - bug-34: open ✓ (closes at M-Push-Foundation merge per Design v1.2 §"Mission-53 absorption")
  - thread-325: closed ✓ (round-2 audit; bilateral seal; close_no_action committed)
  - thread-313: closed ✓ (mission-53 design round; absorbed scope per Design v1.2 §4 + §5)
  - thread-317: closed ✓ (Design v1.1 round-1 audit; superseded by round-2 thread-325)
  - idea-200, idea-201, idea-204, idea-186, idea-202, idea-199 — referenced; statuses orthogonal to this mission (some absorbed; some independent)
- **C4.** Dependency prerequisites: PASS — all upstream missions completed; round-2 audit ratified; cleanup baseline on main; Universal Adapter notification contract spec ratified.

## Category D — Scope-decision gating

- **D1.** Engineer-flagged scope decisions resolved: PASS — round-2 audit (thread-325) substantively answered all 10 round-2 asks. Engineer-final calls: 6-bundled wave decomposition, claim semantics Option (i), `<channel>` 3-family taxonomy, seen-id LRU N=1000, `list_messages` since-cursor W0 spike absorption.
- **D2.** Director + architect aligned: PASS — Design v1.2 PR #62 merged with Director ratifications of all 7 architectural commitments + 7 anti-goals + Universal Adapter framing + Layer-1 sub-organization + 3-layer model. Retrospective PR #66 in flight ratifies cross-approval pattern + autonomous-arc-driving pattern + communication mediation invariant.
- **D3.** Out-of-scope boundaries confirmed: PASS — Design v1.2 §"Out of scope" + 7 binding anti-goals lock scope. M-Adapter-Distribution (`@apnex/*` npm publish) explicitly Tier 2 future mission.

## Category E — Execution readiness

- **E1.** First task clear: PASS — W0 spike scope per Design v1.2 + round-2 audit answer #5 + #6: legacy-entity read-path grep (DirectorNotification + Notification + PendingActionItem), thread-313 scope cross-map, trigger-probability confirm (a) SSE Last-Event-ID partial-existing + (b) MCP-handshake-on-reconnect, `list_messages` since-cursor verify (engineer T1 grep). Engineer can scaffold day-1.
- **E2.** Deploy-gate dependencies: PASS with explicit gate — **Hub redeploy required for W1+W2** (push-on-Message-create handler in `message-policy.ts`; SSE Last-Event-ID protocol in `hub-networking.ts`; subscriber-match resolution; Message-router consuming the new SSE event-type). Architect-owned local Hub redeploy per `feedback_architect_owns_hub_lifecycle.md`. Cloud Run redeploy required separately (Hub server is Cloud Run-deployed).
- **E3.** Success-criteria measurable: PASS — Hub-restart e2e test (push pipeline survives Hub redeploy; missed events replay via Last-Event-ID); cross-package vitest baseline preserved (matches bug-32 pre-existing pattern); bug-34 flippable to resolved with `linkedMissionId: "M-Push-Foundation"` + `fixCommits: <wave-merge-SHAs>`; legacy entity sunset verifiable via read-path-empty grep; ADR-026 ships.

## Category F — Coherence with current priorities

- **F1.** Anti-goals from cleanup mission retrospective hold: PASS — methodology calibrations 1-8 from autonomous-arc retrospective (test rewiring under-estimate, cross-approval pattern, bug-32 stable failure, coord handoff gap, calibration #23 multi-execution, pattern-replication-sizing twice-validated, tele-evaluation post-cleanup, multi-PR velocity skew) all align. Coordination handoff gap is exactly what M-Push-Foundation W1+W2 closes structurally.
- **F2.** No newer missions superseding: PASS — mission-56 IS the newest mission. M-Adapter-Distribution Tier 2 is downstream future scope; not superseding.
- **F3.** Recent bugs/ideas changing scoping: PASS — no bugs/ideas filed since Design v1.2 ratification that materially shift scope. bug-34 is the only in-flight bug touching adapter resilience; absorbed via mission-53 absorption per Design v1.2.

## Verdict summary

**GREEN** — Brief is structurally sound; all 6 categories PASS; round-2 audit ratified at engineer-spec level; Design v1.2 + cleanup baseline + Universal Adapter notification contract all on main.

## Activation gates (Director-action prerequisites)

Two structural gates remain before architect-flip-to-active is appropriate:

1. **Bundled rename PR merged** — `packages/network-adapter/src/session/` → `src/kernel/` + `packages/network-adapter/src/mcp-boundary/` → `src/tool-manager/` per Director ratification at retrospective. Architect dispatches to greg post-retrospective merge; rename ships in standalone PR; merges to main. **Reason:** M-Push-Foundation W2 references Layer-1 subdirs by canonical names; if rename hasn't landed, W2 work would need re-do post-rename. Cleanest sequencing: rename FIRST, then W0 spike.

2. **Director release-gate signal** — `update_mission(mission-56, status="active")` per `mission-preflight.md` §Step 5. Architect can architect-flip per autonomous-arc-driving pattern (mission-54 + mission-55 precedent), OR Director can issue release-gate signal directly. Either path acceptable per autonomous-arc directive ("drive full autonomous next steps until step 5 ... then take full autonomous-driving-arc for end-to-end" — current arc starts here).

Recommended sequence:
1. PR #66 (retrospective) + PR #67 (calibration #23 doc) + PR #68 (this preflight) cross-approve + merge
2. Architect dispatches bundled rename PR work to greg via short thread
3. Greg ships rename PR; cross-approve + merge
4. Architect surfaces full state to Director: "Preflight GREEN, all PRs merged, rename complete, ready for release-gate"
5. Director release-gate fires (or architect-flip per autonomous-arc-driving authority)
6. Architect dispatches W0 spike directive to greg

## Pre-kickoff decisions required

None at the design level (round-2 audit ratified all 10 asks; Q1/Q2/Q10 architect outcomes hold). Sequencing-only pending per gates above.

## Side observations (non-blocking; capture for downstream)

- **mission-53 abandon-with-pointer flip** is a mechanical task during M-Push-Foundation activation; architect runs `update_mission(mission-53, status="abandoned", description="Absorbed into M-Push-Foundation; bug-34 closes at M-Push-Foundation merge")` at activation time
- **Mission-lifecycle.md v1.0 ratification** queued post-M-Push-Foundation merge (Director-ratified at retrospective Open Q3)
- **Multi-agent-pr-workflow.md v1.1** queued post-M-Push-Foundation merge (cross-approval pattern + event-driven workflow formalization)
- **ADR-026** ships as W5 deliverable (push-foundation as canonical event-delivery layer; companion to ADR-024 storage primitive + ADR-025 message primitive)
- **Foreign tree deletion** — Director's choice; no preflight gate; cleanup mission verified deletable
