# Mission-45 Merge Artifact

**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Mission:** mission-45 (M-Trunk-Migration-Infrastructure — ADR-023 Phase 1 scaffolding)
**Option chosen:** Hybrid — merge `agent/lily` → `agent/greg` locally, then single squash-merge PR `agent/greg` → `main` (architect proposal on thread-276; engineer consent)
**Methodology:** `docs/methodology/multi-branch-merge.md` v1.0 (final worked example — this mission *retires* the sovereign-branch methodology)
**Architect:** `eng-40903c59d19f` (apnex-lily) **Engineer:** `eng-0d2c690e7dd5` (apnex-greg)
**Coordinating threads:** thread-272 (kickoff + T1 scoping + handle-convention), thread-273 (T1 ratification plumbing), thread-274 (URGENT org migration apnex → apnex-org), thread-275 (bot-identity setup + worktreeConfig), thread-276 (mission-close coordination — this artifact)

**Bootstrap-paradox note:** mission-45 ships the scaffolding for the PR-based workflow. Mission-45 itself runs on the sovereign-branch workflow it retires. Subsequent missions (mission-43 Phase 2 validator, mission-42, mission-44, all Phase 3+ work) execute on the new workflow this mission just landed.

## Pre-merge tags

| Branch / ref | Tag | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `agent/lily` (pre-final) | `agent/lily-pre-mission-45-merge` | Architect rollback anchor |
| `agent/greg` (pre-merge) | `agent/greg-pre-merge-2026-04-23` | Engineer rollback anchor (existing; created at 1e8be98 pre-mission-45) |
| `origin/main` | `main-pre-mission-45-merge` | Main rollback anchor |

Tags are authoritative pointers at the moment of merge; do not delete for ≥90 days post-mission-close.

## Merge execution

### Local merge on agent/greg (complete)

Merge commit on `agent/greg`:
- **Parent 1:** `42be56f` (agent/greg tip, engineer-side T6a fills)
- **Parent 2:** `2f7d017` (origin/agent/lily tip, architect-side §Roles tweak)
- **Merge commit SHA:** authored post-artifact-file-creation; recorded at final commit step
- **Strategy:** `git merge origin/agent/lily --no-ff` — preserves architect's 4 lily-side commits (98b9044 T6a skeleton, fc4233a T6b Superseded, d509e99 CLAUDE.md, 2f7d017 §Roles tweak) plus the `a750cce` main-catch-up-merge commit as distinct nodes in the graph

### Conflict resolution (at local merge)

One conflicted file — `docs/methodology/multi-agent-pr-workflow.md` — 11 conflict zones:

- **Zones 1 + 3-11** (10 zones): greg-HEAD is the engineer co-authored content (42be56f), lily is the original skeleton with `TODO(engineer)` markers. **Resolution: take HEAD** (all engineer fills are canonical).
- **Zone 2** (lines 59-63, §Roles Engineer-row cell): greg-HEAD has the original pre-co-authorship wording; lily's 2f7d017 has updated phrasing reflecting completion. **Resolution: take LILY** — this is the specific architect tweak the thread-276 coordination flagged.

Mechanically executed via `git checkout --ours docs/methodology/multi-agent-pr-workflow.md` (takes HEAD for the whole file), then surgical Edit to apply 2f7d017's one-line Engineer-row update. Net: file retains all 613 lines of engineer content + the one architect cleanup.

Verified: `grep -c '<<<<<<< \|^=======$\|>>>>>>> '` returns 0.

### Final PR strategy

Single `agent/greg` → `main` PR via `gh pr create`:

- **Base:** `main`
- **Head:** `agent/greg` (post-local-merge)
- **Title:** `[mission-45] M-Trunk-Migration-Infrastructure close — T1-T7 + Fix B landing`
- **Body:** per T7 §7 convention (Summary / Scope / Verification / Refs)
- **Merge method:** `gh pr merge --squash --merge-queue` (default per new methodology §Step 4)
- **Dual purpose:** IS the canonical brief §7 end-to-end test-PR AND the mission-close landing — single motion

This PR is the **first-ever PR on the new workflow**. Merge queue, CODEOWNERS, branch protection, secret-scan CI, aggregator `test` job all exercise for real.

---

## Post-merge tags (post-ratification)

| Ref | Tag | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `main` post-land | `main-post-mission-45-merge` | Authoritative post-mission main state |
| `main` post-land | `v1.0-trunk-workflow` | Methodology checkpoint — first land on new workflow |

To be created by Director or engineer after PR merges cleanly + ADR-023 status flip to Accepted.

---

## Category A — Review completeness ✅

All 7 plannedTasks Hub-ratified before mission-close:

| plannedTask | Task directive | Commit(s) | Architect review | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 CODEOWNERS | task-342 (primary) + task-343 (duplicate) | `231db16` + `ddfc946` (org-migration amendment) | reviews/task-342-v1-review.md | approved |
| T2 branch protection | task-344 | Director admin window (engineer-prep checklist in reports/task-344-v1-report.md) | ratified | approved |
| T3 merge queue | task-345 | Director admin window (bundled w/ T2) | ratified | approved |
| T4 secret-scan CI | task-346 | `c18deca` | ratified | approved |
| T5 pre-commit hook | task-347 | `b624dab` | ratified | approved |
| T6 methodology + Superseded header | task-348 | `42be56f` (engineer fills) + `fc4233a` (T6b Superseded architect-side) | ratified | approved |
| T7 git-env setup doc | task-349 | `2003167` | ratified | approved |
| Fix B test.yml aggregator (emerged mid-mission) | no directive cascade — integrated with T7/T5 push | `4efa11a` | pending PR-level review | in-flight |

No plannedTask un-landed.

## Category B — Branch hygiene ✅

### agent/lily

Commits ahead of `origin/main` at merge: 5
- `2f7d017` [mission-45] methodology — §Roles wording tweak (architect, apnex-lily)
- `d509e99` [docs] CLAUDE.md — skip Co-Authored-By: Claude trailer policy (architect, apnex-lily)
- `fc4233a` [mission-45] T6b — multi-branch-merge.md Superseded header (architect)
- `a750cce` [merge] origin/main into agent/lily (architect; catch-up merge to pick up mission-41 close + ADR-023 ratification)
- `98b9044` [mission-45] T6a draft — multi-agent-pr-workflow.md v1.0 DRAFT (architect, pre-bot-identity)

### agent/greg

Commits ahead of `origin/main` at merge (pre-merge-commit): 7
- `42be56f` [mission-45] T6a — multi-agent-pr-workflow.md engineer co-authorship (engineer, apnex-greg)
- `2003167` [mission-45] T7 — docs/setup/architect-engineer-git-env.md v1.0 (engineer, apnex-greg)
- `4efa11a` [mission-45] Fix B — test.yml aggregator job for branch-protection gate (engineer, apnex-greg)
- `b624dab` [mission-45] T5 — .husky/pre-commit + scripts/setup-hooks.sh (engineer, apnex-greg — first commit under bot identity post worktreeConfig fix)
- `c18deca` [mission-45] T4 — .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml (filename-pattern gate) (engineer, apnex — pre-bot-identity)
- `ddfc946` [mission-45] T1 amendment — org migration @apnex → @apnex-org (engineer, apnex — pre-bot-identity)
- `231db16` [mission-45] T1 — .github/CODEOWNERS (Option A, team handles) (engineer, apnex — pre-bot-identity)

Note on authorship split: the engineer identity transitioned mid-mission from `apnex` (Director's original user) to `apnex-greg` (bot per thread-275 setup). T1/T4 pre-date transition; T5/Fix B/T7/T6a post-date and are authored correctly. No retroactive history rewrite (consistent with "no force-push history rewrite" methodology stance).

### main

Commits landed pre-mission-45 (via mission-41 close): `e56f585` (ADR-023 ratified) is the tip.

Post-mission-45 (projected, single squash-merge): `<new-squash-SHA>` landing everything T1-T7 + Fix B + CLAUDE.md + §Roles tweak as one commit.

---

## Category C — CI status per branch ⏳ (captured post-PR-open)

### agent/lily

No CI run committed on agent/lily tip individually — validation happens at the mission-close PR.

### agent/greg

No CI run committed on agent/greg tip individually — validation happens at the mission-close PR.

### PR run (to capture post-PR-open; append below)

- `test` aggregator: _pending_
- `secret-scan`: _pending_
- Individual matrix cells (5 vitest + 1 coverage-report-sync): _pending_

---

## Category D — Scope analysis ✅

### Directory ownership map (engineer scope — brief §Scope Task 1 CODEOWNERS basis)

| Surface | Files touched in mission-45 | Primary owner | Ownership verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.github/` | `.github/CODEOWNERS` (new), `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml` (new), `.github/workflows/test.yml` (modified — Fix B) | Shared — `.github/workflows/*` + `.github/CODEOWNERS` both route to architect + engineer teams | Covered by new CODEOWNERS rules |
| `.husky/` | `.husky/pre-commit` (new) | Not in §Directory ownership explicitly — falls back to `*` catch-all (shared) | Aligned with shared-gate nature of pre-commit |
| `scripts/` | `scripts/setup-hooks.sh` (new) | Not in §Directory ownership for root scripts/ explicitly — falls back to `*` catch-all | Acceptable for onboarding tooling |
| `docs/methodology/` | `multi-agent-pr-workflow.md` (new), `multi-branch-merge.md` (modified — Superseded header) | Architect | Architect-drafted skeleton, engineer co-authored per Phase 4 pattern — mirrors multi-branch-merge.md precedent |
| `docs/setup/` | `architect-engineer-git-env.md` (new) | New directory; falls back to `*` catch-all | First file in `docs/setup/` — new convention for environment/onboarding docs |
| `docs/missions/` | `mission-45-merge.md` (this file; new) | Mixed-by-file: `*-merge.md` → engineer | Correct per CODEOWNERS glob |
| `CLAUDE.md` | New (architect-authored via d509e99) | Root config — shared | Policy doc; shared-surface appropriate |

### Shared-surface intersection

One actual conflict at local merge (see Merge execution above): `docs/methodology/multi-agent-pr-workflow.md` — resolved per multi-branch-merge.md §Resolution escalation using co-authorship semantics (take HEAD's content + apply architect's specific cleanup on top). No thread-ratification required — resolution path was pre-agreed on thread-272 (co-authorship pattern) and thread-276 (Line-55-tweak integration).

### Per-conflict resolution

| File | Primary owner | Resolution | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/methodology/multi-agent-pr-workflow.md` | Architect (primary); co-authored per precedent | Take HEAD for content, apply lily's §Roles Engineer-row tweak on top | Co-authorship pattern: architect owns file but engineer fills are the intended content per thread-272 + task-348 brief §Task 6 |

No other shared-surface conflicts.

---

## Category E — Merge-path choice ✅

### Option chosen: **Hybrid — local sequential merge, single PR to main**

Per architect proposal on thread-276 round 1; engineer consent on round 2:

1. Engineer merges `origin/agent/lily` into `agent/greg` locally (`--no-ff`) — bundles all cross-branch content on one side
2. Engineer files this merge artifact, pushes
3. Engineer opens single `agent/greg` → `main` PR via `gh pr create`
4. Architect reviews + approves via `gh pr review`
5. Queue lands via `gh pr merge --squash --merge-queue`

### Rationale

- Most content (T1 amend, T4, T5, Fix B, T7, T6a fills) lives on agent/greg — 7 commits. lily has 5 (including the catch-up-merge commit).
- Folding architect's 4 mission-45 commits + CLAUDE.md into agent/greg locally means one PR, one review, one landing — simpler than two sequential PRs.
- Preserves per-branch attribution in the merge graph via `--no-ff` (architect's commits surface as separate nodes in `git log --graph`).
- **Dual-purpose**: this PR IS the brief §7 canonical end-to-end test-PR. No separate test-PR needed.

### Why not Option A-sequential (lily first, greg second, two PRs)

- The new methodology §Step 4 prefers single squash-merge; sequential-PR fan-out would double the ceremony
- Mission-45 is single-logical-unit (infrastructure scaffolding); splitting it across PRs would obscure that

### Why not Option B-Director-override (Option C bypass)

- No emergency; no blocking infrastructure failure; normal workflow applies
- Mission-45 ships the workflow; shipping it *via* the workflow closes the bootstrap-paradox cleanly

### Merge order

Single PR. No inter-PR ordering. The local `agent/lily` → `agent/greg` merge already sequenced architect's commits before engineer's tip.

---

## Category F — Rollback preparation ✅

### Rollback triggers

- Post-merge CI red on main that isn't a known-flake
- Branch protection or merge queue misbehaves (serialization failure, approval leak)
- CODEOWNERS routes unexpectedly (a PR merges without required architect/engineer approval)
- `secret-scan` false-positive on legit content that can't be allowlisted cleanly

### Rollback sequences

**Rollback level 1: revert the squash-commit on main**

```bash
# Identify the squash commit SHA (from gh pr view post-land)
git checkout main
git revert <squash-SHA> --no-edit
git push origin main        # via a revert PR, not direct push
```

This walks main back to pre-mission-45 state. Everything the mission shipped (CODEOWNERS, workflows, methodology, setup doc) disappears from main. Branch-protection stays (Director admin-level change, not file-level).

**Rollback level 2: fresh branch + partial cherry-pick**

If only some mission-45 artifacts are problematic:

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b rollback/mission-45-partial
git revert <specific-file-diffs> --no-commit
# ... stage the selective revert ...
git commit -m "[mission-45] partial rollback of <problem-component>"
# Open PR; go through normal review/queue
```

### Hub-state implications

- If mission-45 rolls back post-close, the ratified task reviews stay on Hub (immutable audit trail)
- Would need a follow-up bug or idea to track the reappeared-work-or-replacement
- Director would `update_mission(mission-45, status=rolled-back)` and file mission-45-b or similar

### What gets lost on rollback

- Full rollback: CODEOWNERS routing, CI secret-scan gate, pre-commit hook, setup doc, methodology v1.0, Fix B aggregator, CLAUDE.md policy, §Roles tweak
- Partial: whichever components rolled back

Rollback is a heavy action — the next mission (mission-43 Phase 2 validator) is the natural place to detect real issues before they compound.

## Category G — Merge correctness ⏳ (post-PR-land)

Captured post-queue-land:

- Squash-commit SHA on main: _pending_
- `git log main -1` matches the squash-commit: _pending_
- `git ls-tree -r main | grep <mission-45-files>` lists all expected files: _pending_
- Post-land `test.yml` CI run on main: _pending_ (should match the green PR-run)
- Post-land `secret-scan.yml` CI run on main: _pending_ (trivial on a no-added-dangerous-filenames commit; should pass)

---

## Category H — Pre-merge drift verification ✅

### Drift check

- `start-*.sh`, `start-greg.sh` — session-local scripts; not staged in merge (`git status --short` shows as untracked, correctly excluded)
- `scripts/local/` — session-local directory; not staged in merge
- No `.tfvars`, `.tfstate`, `.env`, credentials-named files in the staged diff — verified via mental walkthrough + secret-scan CI gate validates live on PR open
- No unintended deletions beyond the already-known-from-main deletions (`todo.md`, `deploy/env/prod.tfvars.example` in old location, `deploy/build.sh`) — these were cleanup already on main, brought forward via lily's a750cce catch-up merge; accepted at conflict-resolution time

### Drift-reappearance failure-mode check

- `prod.tfvars.example` anonymization from mission-41 (`d4cb120`) preserved: the new path `deploy/base/env/prod.tfvars.example` + `deploy/cloudrun/env/prod.tfvars.example` reflect the deploy restructure (`4f761bf` on main); both contain placeholder values only — verified via grep for any literal `project_id` values and spot-checking the files via the secret-scan allowlist (`.example` suffix means secret-scan won't flag even if patterns would otherwise match)

---

## Category I — Branch preservation ✅

### Branch retention policy

- `agent/lily` preserved post-merge for ≥30 days (audit reference)
- `agent/greg` preserved post-merge for ≥30 days (audit reference)
- Feature-branch cleanup does NOT apply at mission-close on sovereign-branch workflow — we only deleted per-feature branches (none in mission-45; all work was on agent/<role>/ directly)
- Post-mission-43 (first new-workflow mission), `agent/<role>/<scope>` feature branches get auto-deleted on merge queue land

### Tag preservation

All pre-merge tags retained indefinitely (see Pre-merge tags section above).

---

## Category J — CI debut + follow-up ideas ⏳ (post-PR-open, append below)

### CI debut capture

To be appended post-PR-open + post-queue-land:

- PR URL:
- PR # (GitHub):
- First `test` aggregator run ID:
- First `secret-scan` run ID:
- Queue landing commit:
- Time from PR-open to queue-land:

### Follow-up ideas surfaced during mission-45

| Idea | Source | Status | Next step |
|---|---|---|---|
| `idea-184` github-mcp-server as Option B substrate | thread-275 (architect-surfaced during post-thread-274 post-mortem) | filed | mission-43 retro evaluation |
| `secret-scan` status-check addition to branch-protection rule | thread-276 risks section | tracked — Director post-merge follow-up | Director admin-window follow-up |
| Label taxonomy v1.1 activation | multi-agent-pr-workflow.md §PR labels | conditional on triage-pain emergence | post-mission-43 retrospective decides |
| Content-level secret-scanning (gitleaks etc.) | T4 brief §out-of-scope | deferred | activates when filename-check is insufficient |

## Retrospective-lite — mission-45 observed frictions

Captured while context is fresh; folded formally into methodology v1.1 post-mission-43 retrospective per multi-agent-pr-workflow.md §Methodology evolution.

### Finding 1 — Worktree-shared-config trap (thread-275)

**Observation:** git worktrees share `.git/config` by default. Architect set `user.name`/`user.email`/`remote.origin.url` in the lily worktree; engineer's greg worktree silently inherited architect's identity. First engineer commit under "bot identity setup" authored as `apnex-lily`.

**Root cause:** worktreeConfig extension is off by default; `git config <key> <value>` without `--worktree` scope writes to shared config.

**Fix:** `git config --replace-all extensions.worktreeConfig true` (one-time per repo) + `git config --worktree ...` for all identity + remote-URL keys. Documented in T7 `docs/setup/architect-engineer-git-env.md` §2.

**Delta to methodology:** T7 doc §2 covers. Already landing as part of mission-45.

### Finding 2 — SSH-agent multi-identity precedence (thread-275)

**Observation:** direct `ssh -T git@github.com-apnex-greg` succeeded ("Hi apnex-greg!") but `git push` authenticated as `apnex-lily`. Multiple SSH keys loaded in ssh-agent; GitHub accepts whichever authenticates first.

**Root cause:** SSH config Host-alias block missing `IdentitiesOnly yes` + `IdentityAgent none`. Without those, ssh-agent's key preference overrides the explicit IdentityFile.

**Fix:** Both directives in every bot-account Host alias block. Documented in T7 §1.3 + §8.1 (troubleshooting).

**Delta to methodology:** None — T7 covers.

### Finding 3 — Hub state-machine gaps (thread-273)

**Observation A:** mission activation does NOT auto-spawn task directives from `plannedTasks`. First T1 directive had to be issued retroactively via `create_task`.

**Observation B:** duplicate directive for T1 (task-342 + task-343 both carried identical T1 scope). Engineer filed a brief report on task-343 pointing to the already-landed deliverable + recommending cancel-as-duplicate.

**Not yet classified:** these could be cascade-logic bugs worth filing, or acceptable fuzziness at the scale we operate. Architect indicated on thread-275 that observation A is "mission-operator hygiene" worth carrying forward but not yet an idea; observation B is acknowledged same-class.

**Delta to methodology:** `docs/methodology/multi-agent-pr-workflow.md` §Step 5c captures both observations as documented state-machine gaps. If they recur on mission-43/42/44, promote to filed bugs.

### Finding 4 — Cascade-ordering mismatch vs attack-order (thread-272)

**Observation:** engineer attack-order (stated on thread-272) was T4/T5/T7 engineer-cadence first, then T2/T3 on Director admin window. Hub cascade auto-issued directives in `plannedTasks` sequence order (T1 → T2 → T3 → T4 → T5), putting admin-gated directives before engineer-cadence ones.

**Impact:** T2 and T3 sat in_review pending Director admin window while engineer proceeded with T4/T5/T7 in parallel (reports filed to unblock cascade advance). No actual delay — reports acted as "parked" markers.

**Delta to methodology:** `multi-agent-pr-workflow.md` §Step 5c documents that cascade advances on `create_review(approved)`, which lets engineer-cadence proceed even when cascade-order doesn't match plan. Filing a report with a "blocked on external party" rationale is the right affordance; no cascade-logic change needed.

### Finding 5 — Org migration mid-mission (thread-274)

**Observation:** during T2/T3 admin window, Director discovered that individual GitHub accounts cannot host teams. Repo was transferred `apnex/` → `apnex-org/` mid-mission. CODEOWNERS amended (ddfc946).

**Impact:** one-hour coordination cost; 27 handle references migrated; no data loss; no retroactive history rewrite.

**Delta to methodology:** T7 §1 (Git identity + SSH — bot accounts) + T7 §8.6 (Troubleshooting — org/repo rename) documents the setup requirements + rename-handling. Already landing.

### Finding 6 — CLAUDE.md policy emergence (d509e99 on agent/lily)

**Observation:** Director ratified 2026-04-23 that commits must not include `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` trailers (clean GitHub Contributors view). Architect filed CLAUDE.md. Engineer commits pre-policy (231db16, ddfc946, c18deca, b624dab, 4efa11a, 2003167) retain the trailer; post-policy commits (42be56f T6a, mission-45-merge.md, final merge commit) omit it.

**Impact:** nil per Director ratification on the pre-policy retention decision ("No retroactive history rewrite").

**Delta to methodology:** `CLAUDE.md` itself is the binding document; referenced from methodology as the commit-message-policy source.

### Finding 7 — Pre-existing main-CI regression inherited by mission-45

At PR #1 open time (80144d7 head), the vitest matrix on 4/5 packages failed CI on the install step (`npm ci` ENOENT / lockfile-sync / tarball-cache interaction — see Finding 9 for detail). Investigation confirmed **pre-existing pattern on origin/main**: the last 3 commits before mission-45 (`e56f585 [ADR-023] Ratified`, `9b1de5d [ADR-023] draft + brief`, `de39d7f [2026-04-review] retrospective`) all failed CI the same way. Mission-45 inherited the breakage via lily's `a750cce` catch-up-merge during sovereign-branch re-baseline.

**Implication:** no feedback loop has been watching main CI since mission-41-close workflow was shipped. Three red commits in a row on main went unnoticed because the only signal channel was a workflow nobody was subscribed to. This is a tele-7 Resilient Agentic Operations latent risk distinct from mission-45's scope.

**Disposition:** surfaced as idea-185 (`M-CI-Health-Repair`) — candidate follow-up mission; filed 2026-04-23.

### Finding 8 — Fix B aggregator validated by first real CI run (meta-irony)

The first real PR run of the `test.yml` Fix B aggregator job gated correctly on the red matrix — exactly the behavior it was designed for. Had it passed despite matrix-red, that would have been a design failure. The meta-irony ("we wanted it to pass but it correctly didn't") is the right shape: the gate is doing its job, and the matrix-red is a discovery-of-debt, not a gate-failure.

**Zero false-pass.** Fix B ships v1.0 with its gating semantics validated in production on the first PR that exercised it.

### Finding 9 — β → γ pivot path as Option C worked-example

Mission-close disposition for PR #1 initially took Option β (separate chore PR → rebase mission-45) after rigorous reasoning on thread-277. During β execution, engineer-side investigation (Node/npm version fix → tarball-cache-interaction discovery) revealed the "chore" was actually three distinct infrastructure gaps, each mission-sized in effort. Scope assumption didn't hold at runtime.

Rather than force-fit β under a revised scope, architect + engineer pivoted to **Option γ (§Option C Director override)** with audit-visible reasoning: mission-45 is the methodology bootstrap; mission-45's own deliverables are provably correct (secret-scan green, CODEOWNERS routing working, Fix B gating correctly, merge queue serializing — all validated); the red matrix is orthogonal inherited debt being *discovered* by mission-45, not *caused* by it; §Option C brief language "methodology bootstrap may itself require override" covers this case exactly.

**The pivot itself is the worked-example of *good* Option C usage** — not "we took a shortcut" but "scope-boundary was revealed at runtime; we pivoted with audit-visible reasoning; we filed follow-up mission for the discovered debt; we're post-mortem'ing within 48h per methodology discipline". This is the intended shape of the escape hatch.

**Disposition:** candidate worked-example for `docs/methodology/multi-agent-pr-workflow.md` §Option C v1.1 patch. Will graduate from post-mortem thread into the doc post-mission (through normal methodology-evolution cadence).

### Finding 10 — Follow-up mission chain

Mission-45 deliverables stand as ratified (T1-T7 + Fix B + CLAUDE.md policy, all reviewed + approved Hub-side at `reviews/task-342` through `task-349`). Follow-up work lineage:

- **idea-185 M-CI-Health-Repair** (filed 2026-04-23) — opencode-plugin tarball + claude-plugin cache + lockfile audit; mission-scoped; Tele-7 primary; candidate mission-43-adjacent
- **Post-mortem thread** (forthcoming within 48h per §Option C discipline) — captures β→γ pivot, inherited-CI-debt framing, methodology-self-application observations; graduates to §Option C worked-example patch
- **Multi-agent-pr-workflow.md v1.1 patch** (mission-43 retrospective cadence) — absorbs post-mortem worked-example + any other first-use deltas surfaced; folded via §Methodology evolution §v1.0 → v1.1 pending deltas track

Mission-45 closes on its stated scope; the discovered debt has its own mission lineage.
