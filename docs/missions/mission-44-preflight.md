**Mission:** M-Cognitive-Layer-Silence-Closure (mission-44)
**Brief:** `docs/reviews/2026-04-phase-4-briefs/m-cognitive-layer-silence-closure.md`
**Preflight author:** architect (lily)
**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Verdict:** **YELLOW** (passes A/B/C/E/F; Category D has 4 items, one of which (Decision 3 — telemetry threshold) is substantive)
**Freshness:** current until 2026-05-23

---

## Category A — Documentation integrity

- **A1.** Brief committed at correct path: **PASS** — `docs/reviews/2026-04-phase-4-briefs/m-cognitive-layer-silence-closure.md` committed in `6625c24` + folded in `732b6b5`
- **A2.** Branch in sync with `origin`: **PASS** — `agent/lily` current
- **A3.** Cross-referenced artifacts present: **PASS** — sibling briefs + cross-mission observations all present

## Category B — Hub filing integrity

- **B1.** Mission entity correct: **PASS** — `id=mission-44`, `status=proposed`, `documentRef` populated
- **B2.** Title + description faithful: **PASS** — description summarizes 3-task scope, M-class, tele-leverage 4, dual-primary-concept (Substrate-First Logic + Precision Context Engineering), CRITICAL severity gate per bug-11, 7-day observation window, deploy-gate flagged
- **B3.** `tasks[]` + `ideas[]` empty: **PASS**

## Category C — Referenced-artifact currency

- **C1.** File paths cited exist:
  - `docs/audits/m-hypervisor-adapter-mitigations-closing-audit.md` (mission-38 closing audit; brief cites for baseline telemetry + 7-mitigation status): ✅ exists
  - `agents/vertex-cloudrun/` (the adapter runtime mission-44 targets): ✅ exists (Dockerfile + src + test + tsconfig.json + vitest.config.ts)
  - Brief-referenced tools + concepts (§2.2 Substrate-First Logic, §2.6 Precision Context Engineering, §3.11 Cognitive Economy cluster) — all in Phase 3 concepts-and-defects register; not re-verified but consistent with brief
- **C2.** Numeric claims verified:
  - "Mission-38 shipped 5 of 7 mitigations": consistent with bug-11 description + brief; not independently counted in this preflight (would require deep mission-38 artifact read)
  - "This mission ships remaining 2" (Phase E pre-hydration + State reconciliation on drift): matches brief's 3-task decomposition
  - "10 observed failures during M-Ideas-Audit": bug-11 description enumerates exactly 10 across 5 threads ✅
  - "21 false-positive Director notifications": bug-11 description; ✅
  - "12/25 score in Phase 2 (CRITICAL + RECURRING)": consistent with Phase 2 symptom-scoring artifact
- **C3.** Bugs / ideas / tasks cited by ID still in assumed state:
  - **bug-11** (primary target): **PASS** — `status=open`, `severity=critical`, `class=cognitive`. Mission's goal (flip to `resolved` post-telemetry) consistent with current state.
  - **idea-132** (scope container for 7 mitigations; cited 6× in brief): not directly fetched (no `get_idea` tool; would require `list_ideas` paginated scan past 100+ entries). Brief cites as "captures the seven proposed mitigations as architect-triageable scope" — internally consistent with bug-11 description's linkage (`tags: ["linked:idea-132"]`). Safe to trust brief on this; engineer will verify state at mission activation per mission-38 pattern.
  - **mission-38** dependency: ⚠️ **FLAG (informational)** — mission-38 itself is still `status=active` (not completed), same as flagged in mission-42 preflight. The relevant *tasks* (task-310 CP2 C2 + task-314 continuation) shipped; that's what the brief leans on. Mission-38's formal flip to `completed` is orthogonal to mission-44 activation.
  - **task-310** (mission-38 CP2 C2 ThreadConvergenceGateError structured format; brief cites as supporting Tool-Error Elision mechanism): **PASS** — shipped within mission-38 per earlier preflight verification.
- **C4.** Dependency prerequisites in stated state:
  - **mission-38 (builds-on)**: partial completion — 5 of 7 mitigations shipped; mission-44 ships the tail. Consistent with brief.
  - **task-310 (shipped)**: ✅ verified previously.
  - **Architect Cloud Run redeploy (hard-gate for prod-effect)**: deploy-capability exists (`agents/vertex-cloudrun/` contains Dockerfile + deploy scaffolding).
  - **#1 M-Workflow-Test-Harness (benefits-from, soft)**: Wave 1 shipped; Wave 2 in progress. Harness available for mission-44 regression tests if engineer opts to use it. Soft-dependency only — mission-internal fault-injection + drift integration tests suffice for v1 per brief.

## Category D — Scope-decision gating

- **D1.** Engineer-flagged scope decisions resolved: **FAIL — 4 items; Decision 3 is substantive**

### Decision 1 — Mission-38 scope honesty acknowledgment (confirm-level)

Brief engineer flag #1: *"Mission-38 already shipped 5 of 7 mitigations — this mission honestly scopes to the remaining 2 + verdict-flip; mission scope is M not L."*

**Status:** Fact statement, not a decision. Brief-time honest-scoping acknowledged. No ratification needed — confirm for the record and move on.

**Proposed default: ACKNOWLEDGE as scope-framing note.**

### Decision 2 — Phase E pre-hydration single-task vs split (confirm-level)

Brief engineer flag #2: *"Phase E pre-hydration scope is the keystone — could itself span multiple tasks if state-snapshot design is non-trivial; architect confirms single-task framing for this pass, but engineer flags split possibility if design surfaces complexity."*

**Status:** Split option reserved mid-mission if complexity surfaces. Architect-engineer alignment on single-task default at activation time. Engineer has authority to split if Task 1 design surfaces complexity; such a split is architect-ratifiable mid-mission per Phase 4 co-authoring cadence.

**Proposed default: RATIFY single-task framing with split-escape-hatch if complexity surfaces.**

### Decision 3 — Telemetry success threshold *(substantive)*

Brief engineer flag #3: *"Telemetry success-criterion threshold (≥50% reduction) is engineer-authored estimate — Director may want a different bar; engineer recommends ≥50% as meaningful-impact threshold below which bug-11 stays open with measurement reason."*

This is the load-bearing Category D item. Brief's success criterion #3 says: *"post-deploy 7-day observation window shows ≥50% reduction in `tool_rounds_exhausted` events for thread-reply paths (compared to pre-mission-38 baseline)"*.

**Three credible bars:**

| Threshold | Rationale | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **≥30%** | Lower bar; captures "any meaningful improvement"; easier to hit | Bug-11 closed with modest-impact fix; may not structurally resolve the class (false victory) |
| **≥50%** (engineer default) | Meaningful-impact threshold; balances rigor and achievability; aligns with typical substrate-mitigation improvement claims | Engineer-authored estimate; could be too tight or too loose depending on real prod telemetry |
| **≥70%** | High bar; strong claim that bug-11 class is structurally addressed | Risks bug-11 staying open indefinitely if mitigations underperform; may force mission-44 scope-expansion into additional mitigations |

**Considerations:**
- Mission-38 shipped 5 mitigations; post-mission-38 telemetry should establish a partial-reduction baseline *before* mission-44 starts. Mission-44's success threshold is then ("post-mission-44 rate" vs "pre-mission-38 rate"), not ("post-mission-44 rate" vs "post-mission-38 rate"). Director should be clear on which baseline — brief says "pre-mission-38 baseline" which is the correct choice (measures *full* 7-mitigation-set impact).
- ≥50% is a reasonable default for a first-run empirical validation. Too-tight thresholds force re-openings; too-loose thresholds produce false-closures. 50% is defensible center.
- Alternative framing: leave threshold at ≥50% BUT add qualifier that bug-11 can be closed at <50% if there's a **measurement-based rationale** for why the remaining events are un-preventable-by-this-mission (e.g., specific non-cognitive root causes that need a different mission).

**Architect recommendation: Ratify ≥50% with qualifier clause.**

Specifically: "≥50% reduction in `tool_rounds_exhausted` (vs pre-mission-38 baseline) closes bug-11. <50% reduction keeps bug-11 open unless the closing-audit provides measurement-based evidence that the remaining events are root-caused outside this mission's scope (e.g., specific non-cognitive pathways)." This gives the ratchet the teeth to fail honest but allows graceful closure if the mitigations addressed their target class but leftover events are an orthogonal bug-class.

### Decision 4 — Deploy-gate confirm (confirm-level)

Brief engineer flag #4: *"Deploy-gate is explicit — Architect Cloud Run redeploy required for prod-effect; per mission-38's deploy-gap lesson, engineer flags upfront so it's not discovered mid-mission."*

**Status:** Fact statement, documented. Architect Cloud Run redeploy is in-scope per Task 1 Phase E pre-hydration. No action beyond ratification.

**Proposed default: RATIFY as briefed.**

- **D2.** Director + architect alignment: **PENDING** — Decision 3 needs Director ratification on threshold + qualifier clause
- **D3.** Out-of-scope boundaries confirmed: **PASS** — brief §Out of scope lists 4 explicit exclusions (idea-107 broader Cognitive-Hypervisor phases; idea-152 Smart NIC Adapter; idea-138 per-prompt cognitive-layer routing; idea-116 Precision Context Engineering beyond state pre-hydration); boundaries hold

## Category E — Execution readiness

- **E1.** First task clear, day-1 scaffoldable: **PASS** — Task 1 Phase E pre-hydration is well-scoped; engineer can scaffold immediately: adapter preloads thread state + participant set + active tool surface + pending-action queue snapshot into prompt preamble; pattern guided by idea-114 state-sync drift-reconciliation
- **E2.** Deploy-gate dependencies explicit: **PASS with ordering-flag** — Architect Cloud Run redeploy required mid-mission (after Task 1 implementation). Engineer flagged upfront per mission-38 lesson. Deploy-gate triggers prod-effect; telemetry baseline accumulates in the 7-day window *after* deploy
- **E3.** Success-criteria metrics measurable from current baseline: **PASS with dependency** — brief references "pre-mission-38 baseline"; that baseline telemetry should be documented in `docs/audits/m-hypervisor-adapter-mitigations-closing-audit.md` (mission-38 closing audit). Engineer should verify at Task 3 (verdict-flip) implementation. Pre-requisite — baseline data must be retrievable, not lost

## Category F — Coherence with current priorities

- **F1.** Anti-goals hold: **PASS** — Phase 4 §6 anti-goals + cross-mission anti-goals all remain valid
- **F2.** No superseding missions: **PASS** — mission-41/42/43 are sibling Phase 4 winners with distinct scope; no newer filings
- **F3.** No recent bugs/ideas materially change scope: **PASS** — no intervening changes affecting cognitive-layer scope

---

## Verdict summary

**YELLOW** — Mission-44 is mostly activation-ready with one substantive Category D item (Decision 3 telemetry threshold). Categories A/B/C/E/F pass cleanly. bug-11 is CRITICAL-severity and currently-open; this mission is the structural closure path. Engineer-flagged scope decisions are 1 substantive + 3 confirm-level. Mission remains in `proposed` status pending Director release-gate signal (separate from preflight ratification).

## Pre-kickoff decisions required (for YELLOW → GREEN)

1. **Decision 1 (mission-38 scope honesty):** acknowledge as scope-framing note (architect recommends)
2. **Decision 2 (Phase E single-task vs split):** ratify single-task with split-escape-hatch (architect recommends)
3. **Decision 3 (telemetry threshold):** **substantive** — ratify ≥50% reduction with qualifier clause allowing <50% closure if measurement-based rationale for root-cause-outside-mission-scope (architect recommends)
4. **Decision 4 (deploy-gate):** ratify as briefed (architect recommends)

**Estimated kickoff duration:** ~20-30 minutes (Decision 3 is the only substantive item; others are confirm-level).

## Timing + coordination with other missions

- **Mission-41 Wave 2:** task-338 (INV-TH19 graduation) in progress; Wave 2 closure imminent. Wave 3 post-closure; no direct mission-44 dependency
- **Mission-42:** on hold; bug-23 Task 4 ADR ratified. Mission-44 can activate independently — no Hub FSM changes in mission-44 scope
- **Mission-43:** pre-ratified, awaiting release-gate. Mission-44 can activate independently

Mission-44 can activate anytime once Decision 3 is ratified. Engineer bandwidth is the real constraint — mission-41 Wave 2 engineer work is in-flight; mission-44 activation would either serialize after Wave 2 closes (engineer-time clean) or require a second engineer (per cross-mission observations two-engineer plan).

---

## Runtime-role note (informational)

Mission-44 targets the `agents/vertex-cloudrun/` architect runtime. My current session (lily, claude-plugin-as-architect) is a different runtime. Mission-44's scope is orthogonal to my runtime — I architect-review engineer's work on vertex-cloudrun without my session being the deployment target. No runtime collisions between mission-44 execution and my session's continued architect activity.

This note is not a decision; preserving the observation because the cross-runtime architecture might be non-obvious to future preflight readers.

## Preflight audit trail

- Hub state queried: `get_mission(mission-44)`, `get_bug(bug-11)` — both confirmed current
- Brief read: `docs/reviews/2026-04-phase-4-briefs/m-cognitive-layer-silence-closure.md` (156 lines; 6× idea-132 citations)
- Path verification: `docs/audits/m-hypervisor-adapter-mitigations-closing-audit.md` ✓; `agents/vertex-cloudrun/` ✓
- Cross-mission check: no superseding filings; missions 41/42/43 don't block mission-44 activation

---

*Preflight v1.0 per `docs/methodology/mission-preflight.md` procedure. Fourth and final preflight across the Phase 4 winner set; completes the methodology dry-run cycle. No Category-C-class surprises this time (contrast to mission-43's zombie-cleanup obsolescence). Decision 3 is the lone substantive ratification — parallel to mission-42's ADR-022 in kind but smaller in architectural surface.*
