# Mission-57 (M-Mission-Pulse-Primitive) Preflight Check

**Mission:** M-Mission-Pulse-Primitive
**Brief:** mission entity description (no separate documentRef; in-entity-brief pattern matching missions 50-56; Design v1.0 at `docs/designs/m-mission-pulse-primitive-design.md` is the binding scope source-of-truth + Survey artifact at `docs/designs/m-mission-pulse-primitive-survey.md` is the pre-Design intent envelope)
**Preflight author:** lily / architect
**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Verdict:** **GREEN**
**Freshness:** current (until 2026-05-26)
**Activation status:** READY pending Director release-gate signal `update_mission(mission-57, status="active")` (no other gates outstanding; this is the cleanest preflight in the lineage)

---

## Category A — Documentation integrity

- **A1.** Brief location: PASS — entity description compactly summarizes mission scope; references Design v1.0 (`docs/designs/m-mission-pulse-primitive-design.md` commit `a8e9aca` on main) as binding scope source-of-truth + Survey artifact (`docs/designs/m-mission-pulse-primitive-survey.md` commit `a8e9aca`) as pre-Design intent envelope. In-entity-brief pattern matching missions 50-56.
- **A2.** Branch sync: PASS — main HEAD `a8e9aca` (PR #84 merge); Design v1.0 + Survey artifact + mission-56 retrospective + closing audit + ADR-026 all on main. No documentary PRs in flight blocking activation.
- **A3.** Cross-referenced artifacts exist: PASS —
  - `docs/designs/m-mission-pulse-primitive-design.md` v1.0 ✓ (commit `a8e9aca`)
  - `docs/designs/m-mission-pulse-primitive-survey.md` ✓ (commit `a8e9aca`)
  - `docs/audits/m-push-foundation-closing-audit.md` ✓ (mission-56 closing audit; commit `eb1021b`)
  - `docs/decisions/026-push-pipeline-and-message-router.md` ✓ (ADR-026; commit `eb1021b`)
  - `docs/reviews/m-push-foundation-retrospective.md` ✓ (commit `36c9e1d`)
  - `docs/methodology/mission-preflight.md` ✓ (this preflight follows it)
  - `docs/methodology/mission-lifecycle.md` v0.1 ✓ (will co-ship v1.0 at W4 D5)
  - thread-349 (Design phase brainstorm; converged) ✓
  - thread-350 (PR-review for #84; sealed) ✓
  - mission-56 retrospective §5.4.1 mission-class taxonomy ✓ (this mission's class = `coordination-primitive-shipment`)
  - mission-56 retrospective §7.5 forward tele-9 advance ✓ (this mission realizes)

## Category B — Hub filing integrity

- **B1.** Entity correctly filed: PASS — id=mission-57, status=proposed, correlationId=mission-57, sourceThreadId=null, sourceActionId=null (architect-direct create_mission consistent with mission-54 + mission-55 + mission-56 pattern), createdBy.role=system/agentId=hub-system. idea-206 linked via update_idea(missionId=mission-57; status=incorporated).
- **B2.** Title + description faithful: PASS — title "M-Mission-Pulse-Primitive" matches Design v1.0 + thread-349; description is comprehensive structured brief with goal + scope + 5-wave decomposition + 7 architectural commitments + 12 anti-goals + tele alignment + sizing + sequencing + cross-references + provenance.
- **B3.** tasks[] + ideas[] state: PASS — `tasks[]` empty at preflight time (cascade auto-issues plannedTasks on advancement); `ideas[]` empty (idea-206 is the source idea, linked via missionId field on idea-206 entity, NOT in mission.ideas[] which is for downstream-spawned ideas). 5 plannedTasks bound at create_mission call (W0/W1/W2/W3/W4 unissued; cascade auto-advances).

## Category C — Referenced-artifact currency

- **C1.** File paths cited in brief: PASS — verified above (Design v1.0, Survey artifact, mission-56 closing audit, ADR-026, retrospective, methodology docs all currently on main).
- **C2.** Numeric claims: PASS — sizing L lower edge (~6-8 eng-days; W0-W4 decomposition; sub-2-week); pulse cadence floor 60s (sub-minute anti-pattern); seen-id-equivalent: deterministic migrationSourceId per `nextFireDueAt`; 60s sweeper tick; default missedThreshold 3 (matches W3.2 ADR-017 receipt-deadline-missed-3x precedent). All design choices ratified at Design v1.0 + bilateral round-2 audit thread-349; not measurements requiring re-verification.
- **C3.** Cited ideas/bugs/threads/missions in assumed state:
  - mission-50 (Storage-Provider): completed ✓
  - mission-51 (Message primitive): completed ✓ (W4 Scheduled-Message primitive; not consumed by pulse per Q1 verdict but referenced in §9 as related primitive)
  - mission-52 (Repo-Event-Bridge producer): completed ✓
  - mission-54 (recon): completed ✓
  - mission-55 (cleanup): completed ✓
  - mission-56 (M-Push-Foundation): **completed** ✓ (substrate stack consumed: ADR-024 storage + ADR-025 Message + ADR-026 push pipeline; W2.x adapter integration consumed by §5; W3.2 claim/ack FSM consumed by §4 webhook; W4.1 helper-pattern referenced)
  - idea-206 (M-Mission-Pulse-Primitive): **incorporated** ✓ (linked to mission-57 via update_idea)
  - idea-207 (M-PAI-Saga-On-Messages): open ✓ (sister Tier 2; orthogonal)
  - idea-208 (M-Dogfood-CI-Automation): open ✓ (sister Tier 2; orthogonal; could verify pulse via dogfood)
  - thread-349 (Design phase): converged ✓ (close_no_action committed; bilateral)
  - thread-350 (PR #84 review): closed via convergence ✓ (architect stage committed; greg engineer-pool ✓)
- **C4.** Dependency prerequisites: PASS — all upstream missions completed; substrate stack on main; Design v1.0 bilateral-ratified; Survey envelope locked; no pending downstream blockers.

## Category D — Scope-decision gating

- **D1.** Engineer-flagged scope decisions resolved: PASS — bilateral exchange thread-349 round 1+2+3 substantively answered all 7 architect open questions + 6 engineer-surfaced surfaces + 7 round-2 refinements (3 engineer-final + 2 BLOCKING-fixed + 2 minor). Engineer-final calls: dedicated PulseSweeper (NOT scheduled-message-sweeper); webhook path (NOT poll); 3-condition missed-count guard; (unset)/legacy missionClass NO-PULSE; architectPulse responseShape `short_status`; auto-inject defaults for precondition + firstFireDelaySeconds + missedThreshold. **One engineer-final corner case at W2 implementation:** escalation-key idempotency (Option C lean: drop migrationSourceId on escalation Messages; W2 implementer decides at code-time; non-blocking per Design v1.0 ratification).
- **D2.** Director + architect aligned: PASS — Survey envelope (Director-ratified picks Q1=A+C / Q2=B+D / Q3=C / Q4=D / Q5=B / Q6=D) anchors all design-mechanics decisions. Director re-ratified Survey-then-Design as first-class methodology post-execution. No Design-mechanics surfaces required Director re-engagement (Q5 sub-axis interpreted as Design-time-bounded "default 2-3, configurable" → engineer-final at default 3; faithful to envelope).
- **D3.** Out-of-scope boundaries confirmed: PASS — Design v1.0 §8 12 binding anti-goals lock scope (NO Director-watchdog pulse; NO Hub-baked cadence defaults; NO Design-doc-prescriptive runtime config; NO direct Director observability optimization; NO new MCP verbs; NO scheduled-message-sweeper composition; NO runtime-string-expression preconditions; NO sub-minute pulse cadences; NO breaking changes to existing mission entity surface; NO breaking changes to W2.x notificationHooks contract; NO regression on bug-32 baseline; NO direct Director↔engineer surfaces). Sister Tier 2 follow-ons (idea-207 PAI saga; idea-208 CI dogfood; M-Adapter-Distribution) explicitly orthogonal.

## Category E — Execution readiness

- **E1.** First task clear: PASS — W0 spike scope per Design v1.0 §7 W0: D1 mission entity schema grep + D2 mission-policy.ts cascade-handlers + MissionRepository.updateMission signature check + D3 task-316 plannedTasks cascade interaction + D4 pulse-adjacent surface inventory + D5 spike report doc with W2 escalation-key engineer-final note. Engineer can scaffold day-1; cascade auto-issues W0 task on first advancement opportunity.
- **E2.** Deploy-gate dependencies: PASS with explicit gate — **Hub redeploy required for W2** (PulseSweeper construction in `hub/src/index.ts` + PulseSweeper class in `hub/src/policy/pulse-sweeper.ts` + `message-policy.ts:ackMessage` extension for webhook-cascade); architect-owned local Hub redeploy per `feedback_architect_owns_hub_lifecycle.md`. Cloud Run redeploy required separately (Hub server is Cloud Run-deployed). **Substrate-self-dogfood applicability:** likely YES — pulse primitive ships in W2; subsequent W3+W4 waves could substrate-self-dogfood (pulse-driven coord during pulse-mission's own execution). Per `feedback_substrate_self_dogfood_discipline.md` 5-requirement pattern, W2 is the dogfood gate; W2 sub-PR merge + Hub redeploy + adapter restart + verification protocol mandatory if architect+engineer want to consume pulse during W3+W4 execution.
- **E3.** Success-criteria measurable: PASS — Hub vitest baseline + sweeper FSM coverage at W4 D1; adapter integration tests at W4 D2; observability metrics at W4 D3 (pulse-fire/missed-pulse/escalation rates); ADR-027 ships at W4 D4; mission-lifecycle.md v1.0 ratification at W4 D5; closing audit at W4 D6. Bug-32 cross-package vitest baseline preserved (admin-merge per established pattern).

## Category F — Coherence with current priorities

- **F1.** Anti-goals from mission-56 retrospective hold: PASS — methodology stack (autonomous-arc-driving pattern + mediation invariant + mechanise+declare doctrine + Survey-then-Design + mission-class taxonomy + substrate-self-dogfood discipline + complete-mission-scope-methodically + wakeup-cadence-15min-cap) all binding for mission-57 execution. Coordination-primitive-shipment class signature (1-2 ops / 1-2 retire / medium calibration ~3-5) applies; calibration cadence forecast supports L lower-edge sizing.
- **F2.** No newer missions superseding: PASS — mission-57 IS the newest mission. idea-207 + idea-208 + M-Adapter-Distribution Tier 2 sister missions; not superseding.
- **F3.** Recent bugs/ideas changing scoping: PASS — bug-40 (Hub presence-projection drift; filed during mission-56) is orthogonal; not gating mission-57. No bugs/ideas filed since Design v1.0 ratification that materially shift scope.

## Verdict summary

**GREEN** — Brief is structurally sound; all 6 categories PASS; bilateral Design ratification at engineer-spec level (thread-349 round 8); Survey envelope Director-anchored; substrate stack (storage + Message + push pipeline + 3-layer adapter) all on main from mission-50/51/56 lineage.

This preflight is **the cleanest in the lineage to date** — no upstream PR sequencing gates outstanding (only Director release-gate). Survey-then-Design methodology + bilateral-architect-engineer-Design phase delivers a tight pre-activation state.

## Activation gates (Director-action prerequisites)

ONE structural gate remains before architect-flip-to-active is appropriate:

1. **Director release-gate signal** — `update_mission(mission-57, status="active")` per `docs/methodology/mission-preflight.md` §Step 5. Per autonomous-arc-driving pattern + Survey-then-Design methodology, this is the architect's surface to Director (categorised: HOLD-point gate per categorised-concerns table). Director acknowledges preflight + signals release-gate → architect dispatches W0.

Recommended sequence:
1. ✅ PR #84 (Design v1.0 + Survey artifact) merged
2. ✅ mission-57 created at status=proposed (Manifest cascade fired)
3. ✅ idea-206 incorporated → mission-57
4. ✅ This preflight artifact authored
5. ⏳ Architect surfaces preflight + release-gate ratification ask to Director (this is the categorised surface)
6. ⏳ Director release-gate fires (`update_mission(mission-57, status="active")`)
7. ⏳ Architect dispatches W0 spike directive to greg via fresh thread (cascade auto-issues W0 task on first advancement opportunity OR architect-direct dispatch)

## Pre-kickoff decisions required

None at the design level (Design v1.0 bilateral-ratified; all 7 commitments + 6 surfaces + 7 round-2 refinements adopted). One engineer-final at W2 code-time:

- **W2 escalation-key idempotency option** (per thread-349 round 8): Option C lean (drop migrationSourceId on escalation Messages; ULID-keyed Message naturally unique; one duplicate per N years acceptable). W2 implementer (engineer) makes the call at code-time; not a Director decision; not gating preflight.

## Side observations (non-blocking; capture for downstream)

- **First canonical execution of Survey-then-Design methodology** — post-mission-57 ship, `docs/methodology/idea-survey.md` should be authored as canonical execution example reference (queued task #32)
- **First canonical execution of §5.4.1 mission-class taxonomy** — mission-57 declares `coordination-primitive-shipment` class; mission-lifecycle.md v1.0 (W4 D5) codifies the taxonomy + per-class default cadence template
- **Substrate-self-dogfood opportunity at W3+W4** — once W2 PulseSweeper ships + Hub redeploys, architect+engineer could opt-in to consuming pulse during W3+W4 execution (per `feedback_substrate_self_dogfood_discipline.md` 5-requirement pattern); explicit dogfood gate at W2 sub-PR merge per pattern
- **idea-208 M-Dogfood-CI-Automation pairing** — could ship before mission-57 W2 (verifies pulse) OR after (pulse benefits from CI dogfood automation); strategic-review at next mission-selection moment
- **mission-lifecycle.md v1.0 ratification co-ships at W4 D5** — codifies pulse semantics + missionClass field + Survey-then-Design as first-class lifecycle phase + autonomous-arc-driving pattern + substrate-self-dogfood discipline + ScheduleWakeup-vs-pulse boundary
- **`feedback_wakeup_cadence_15min_max` 15min cap** retired by pulse adoption (cap holds until mission-57 ships; pulse takes over recurring case; one-off ScheduleWakeup retained per S5)
- **Methodology calibration data point captured** at thread-350 round 4: Director "Mission A / Idea 206" selection → mission-57 created at status=proposed elapsed ~80min; Director time-cost ~5min in this window; ~36-50× compression vs mission-56 lineage
