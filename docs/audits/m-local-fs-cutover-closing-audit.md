# Mission M-Local-FS-Cutover — Closing Report

**Hub mission id:** mission-48
**Mission brief:** scoped via thread-303 (architect lily ↔ engineer greg, converged 2026-04-25, 5 rounds). Director ratified β split sequencing 2026-04-25 (round 5) — mission-49 prerequisite migration first; mission-48 cutover after.
**Resolves:** thread-303 Flag #1 (audit/notification durability, addressed by mission-49 prerequisite) + Flag #1b (NODE_ENV=production gate hard-refusal, addressed by T1 amendment) + Flag #2 (Docker bind-mount uid/gid, addressed by T1 + dual-layer writability assertion). Closes the local-fs cutover phase of the β-split sequence.
**ADR:** [`docs/decisions/024-sovereign-storage-provider.md`](../decisions/024-sovereign-storage-provider.md) §6.1 Amendment 2026-04-25 — local-fs profile reclassification (dev-only → also single-writer-laptop-prod-eligible).
**Dates:** Scoped + activated 2026-04-25 (post-mission-49 close); T1+T2a+T2b+T2c+T3+T4 all shipped 2026-04-25.
**Scope:** 6-task decomposition — T1 Docker state-mount + uid/gid + ADR-024 amendment, T2a cutover bootstrap script, T2b default flip + bootstrap-required guard, T2c reverse-direction sync, T3 dogfood + drill procedures, T4 closing hygiene (this report + runbook consolidation + idea-193 fold).
**Tele alignment:** tele-3 Sovereign Composition SECONDARY (operational use of mission-47's contract); not a new architectural play. tele-3 PRIMARY for the prerequisite mission-49.

## 1. Deliverable scorecard

| Task | Source directive | Status | Branch artifact | PR | Test count delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | Docker state-mount + uid/gid handshake + ADR-024 gate relaxation | ✅ Merged | `1e61226` | #24 | +0 (existing tests pass; manual smoke deferred to T3) |
| T2a | Cutover bootstrap (state-sync.sh extension + invariant + sentinel + tmp-file exclusion primer) | ✅ Merged | `bc5dbb6` | #25 | 0 (shell-only; fake-gsutil smoke matrix passed) |
| T2b | Flip laptop-Hub default to local-fs + bootstrap-required sentinel guard | ✅ Merged | `34b225a` | #26 | +7 (cutover-sentinel.test.ts; was 51/748/5 → 52/755/5) |
| T2c | Reverse-direction sync (local→GCS) with `--yes` safety + symmetric invariant | ✅ Merged | `8c420c7` | #27 | 0 (shell-only; 5-test fake-gsutil smoke matrix passed) |
| T3 | Dogfood validation + Hub-restart-mid-mission readback assertion + live rollback drill | ✅ Merged | `f0ba9a2` | #28 | 0 (docs-only; live drill operator-side per Director α-path) |
| T4 | Closing hygiene + idea-193 fold + this report | ⏳ This PR | (pending merge) | (this PR) | 0 (docs-only) |

**Aggregate:**
- 5 of 6 PRs merged; T4 in-flight.
- Hub test baseline: 52 files / 755 passing / 5 skipped at T2b → unchanged through T2c, T3, T4 (no further hub source changes; T2c shell-only, T3 + T4 docs-only).
- Cumulative diff (T1-T4) — ship-discipline: small, focused PRs each landing a single architectural unit + matching trace patch.

**Test counts at mission close:**
- Hub: 52 files / 755 passing / 5 skipped (was 51/748/5 at mission-49 close — delta +1 file / +7 tests / 0 regressions; all from T2b's cutover-sentinel.test.ts).
- @ois/storage-provider: 2 files / 40 passing (unchanged — no contract delta; the 6-primitive surface held).
- Build + typecheck: clean throughout.

## 2. Mission goal + success framing

**Parent ask** (Director via thread-303 Flag #1 surface): make local-fs the laptop-Hub prod default for a deployment pattern where Hub state lives on a host-mounted directory, durable across container lifecycle, with a bootstrap path FROM the canonical GCS state and a rollback path TO it. Bind-mount uid/gid mismatch (the trap at the heart of every Docker-bind-mount-with-non-root-user story) must be caught loudly at startup.

**Mission goal:** ship the smallest cutover-shaped tooling + Hub-side guards that make `STORAGE_BACKEND=local-fs` the laptop-Hub default for fresh-clone or upgrading operators, with explicit pre-flight validation, durable bootstrap, durable rollback, and explicit operational documentation.

**Success criteria** (per thread-303 convergence + T3 verification handoff):

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hub container mounts a host directory; state persists across `docker stop && docker start` | ⏳ PROVABLE post-operator-redeploy + drill | Code: T1 wiring + T2b default flip; Verification: drill procedures at `docs/runbooks/m-local-fs-cutover-drills.md` §2 (operator-side execution per Director α-path 2026-04-25) |
| 2 | One-time GCS→local-fs bootstrap copy; idempotent re-run | ✅ MET | T2a `scripts/state-sync.sh` extension + 4-scenario fake-gsutil smoke matrix verified bootstrap-green / divergence-red / restore-green / idempotent-rerun |
| 3 | Manual GCS push for backup (reverse-sync) | ✅ MET | T2c `--reverse --yes` flag + 5-test fake-gsutil smoke (forward baseline / refused-without-yes / reverse-with-yes-succeeds / sentinel-stays-local / .tmp.* exclusion) |
| 4 | No automated sync mechanism in scope | ✅ MET (anti-goal preserved) | No watchers / cron / triggers added; sync is operator-invoked only |
| 5 | Rollback verified: `STORAGE_BACKEND=gcs` flip works cleanly | ⏳ PROVABLE post-operator-drill | Code: T2c reverse-sync + start-hub.sh env-var override + Hub-side branching; Verification: drill at runbook §3 (operator-side per Director α-path) |
| 6 | GCS remains available as a manual sync target | ✅ MET | No GCS-write disabling in scope; `STORAGE_BACKEND=gcs` continues to work; T2c gives a clean manual reverse-sync path |
| 7 | ADR-024 amendment ratified | ✅ MET | T1 amendment §6.1 — local-fs reclassified single-writer-laptop-prod-eligible; gate at `hub/src/index.ts:106-109` relaxed warn-and-allow; the `concurrent:false` capability flag still rules out multi-writer profiles by contract |

**Success anti-criterion:** _"laptop-Hub deployment can't introduce silent data corruption (concurrent writes against the same state dir) or silent data loss (rollback without reverse-sync)."_

**Status:** ✅ MET BY CONSTRUCTION:
- Concurrent writes blocked operationally by `scripts/local/start-hub.sh:148-161` one-hub-at-a-time enforcement; `concurrent:false` capability flag still rules out the pattern at the contract layer for non-laptop targets (Cloud Run / multi-instance).
- Silent rollback data loss prevented by T2c `--yes` requirement + the documented "Scenario B" rollback pattern in `deploy/README.md` (always reverse-sync first when post-cutover writes exist).

## 3. Per-task architecture recap

### 3.1 T1 — Docker state-mount + uid/gid handshake + ADR-024 gate relaxation

Full detail in PR #24 / `1e61226`. Key surfaces:

- **`scripts/local/start-hub.sh` env-var fallthrough.** `STORAGE_BACKEND` and `OIS_LOCAL_FS_ROOT` caller-overridable; defaults `gcs` (T1) → `local-fs` (T2b flip).
- **Docker `-v` bind mount** of `${OIS_LOCAL_FS_ROOT}` into the container at the same path; conditional on `STORAGE_BACKEND=local-fs`.
- **`docker run -u $(id -u):$(id -g)`** — host uid/gid used unconditionally so bind-mount writes land host-owned (operability win for operator inspection of `local-state/`).
- **Defense-in-depth writability check:** start-hub.sh shell-layer probe + Hub-side fail-fast assertion in `hub/src/index.ts` with explicit `EACCES`/`EPERM` diagnostic naming uid/gid mismatch as the #1 cause + the fix command.
- **ADR-024 §6.1 amendment** — local-fs reclassified single-writer-laptop-prod-eligible. The fatal-exit at `hub/src/index.ts:106-109` was relaxed to warn-and-allow; warning still surfaces single-writer constraint + start-hub.sh enforcement reference.

### 3.2 T2a — Cutover bootstrap

Full detail in PR #25 / `bc5dbb6`. Key surfaces:

- **`TMP_FILE_EXCLUDE_REGEX='.*\.tmp\..*'`** constant added to state-sync.sh; passed to `gsutil rsync -x`. Defensive in forward direction; load-bearing in reverse direction (T2c primer).
- **Post-copy set-equality invariant** — `gsutil ls -r` vs `find -type f`, normalized (sed-strip-bucket-prefix, drop `:`-suffix directory markers, drop blanks, drop tmp + script artifacts), sorted, diffed. Non-empty diff → exit 1 with explicit `<` GCS-only / `>` local-only path-diff output.
- **`.cutover-complete` sentinel** written to `${ROOT}/.cutover-complete` ONLY after invariant green. Contains timestamp_utc + gcs_source + local_root + script_commit (HEAD SHA) + script_invocation epoch.
- **Bootstrap idempotence** — re-running after a successful bootstrap is a no-op (rsync skips matching files; invariant re-passes; sentinel timestamp refresh).
- **Best-effort smoke** against a fake-gsutil harness (4 scenarios: bootstrap green / divergence red / restore green / idempotent rerun); operator-side smoke against a real GCS bucket deferred to T3.

### 3.3 T2b — Default flip + bootstrap-required sentinel guard

Full detail in PR #26 / `34b225a`. Key surfaces:

- **`STORAGE_BACKEND` default in `scripts/local/start-hub.sh` flipped** `gcs` → `local-fs`. Operators can still set `STORAGE_BACKEND=gcs` explicitly to roll back.
- **`hub/src/lib/cutover-sentinel.ts` new helper** — `CUTOVER_SENTINEL_FILENAME = ".cutover-complete"`, `cutoverSentinelPath(root)`, `isCutoverComplete(root)`. Defensive: returns `false` on non-existent root, fs errors, and `.cutover-complete/` as a directory.
- **Hub-side bootstrap-required guard** — refuses to start under local-fs if the sentinel is missing. FATAL message names the missing path + the fix (`scripts/state-sync.sh`) + a fresh-start escape hatch (state-sync.sh against an empty bucket trivially passes invariant + writes sentinel).
- **7 unit tests** in `hub/test/unit/cutover-sentinel.test.ts` — covers happy path + 4 edge cases (sentinel-as-directory defensiveness, non-existent path, non-existent root, fs errors).

### 3.4 T2c — Reverse-direction sync with `--yes` safety + symmetric invariant

Full detail in PR #27 / `8c420c7`. Key surfaces:

- **Bidirectional refactor** — `scripts/state-sync.sh` ~76% rewrite. New flags: `--reverse` (flip direction local-fs → GCS), `--yes` (required when --reverse), `-h/--help`. Without `--yes`, `--reverse` refuses with explicit error + exit 1.
- **Symmetric invariant** — same set-equality check applied in both directions; failure-cause guidance customizes per direction.
- **Sentinel handling diverges** — forward writes the sentinel (T2a behavior); reverse explicitly does NOT touch it (sentinel reflects the LAST FORWARD bootstrap, not the last reverse upload — rewriting on reverse would mislead future cold-engineer pickup).
- **`SCRIPT_ARTIFACT_REGEX`** drops `.cutover-complete` + `.hub-writability-*` + `.start-hub-writability-*` from both sides of the invariant diff so they don't propagate or re-fail.
- **5-test fake-gsutil smoke matrix** — forward baseline / reverse-without-yes refused / reverse-with-yes succeeds + sentinel stays local / reverse idempotent rerun / `.tmp.*` exclusion verified.

### 3.5 T3 — Dogfood validation + Hub-restart-mid-mission readback + live rollback drill

Full detail in PR #28 / `f0ba9a2`. Key surfaces:

- **`docs/runbooks/m-local-fs-cutover-drills.md`** new operator-side runbook (~270 lines; new directory convention). Sections: §0 pre-flight (container rebuild + bootstrap + start), §1 dogfood entity-type enumeration with explicit honest scope, §2 Hub-restart-mid-mission readback assertion (load-bearing), §3 live rollback drill consuming T2c, §4 reporting-back semantics.
- **Engineer-side container-rebuild verification** — `bash -n scripts/local/build-hub.sh` clean; tfvars + gcloud SDK available; exact rebuild command documented (`OIS_ENV=prod scripts/local/build-hub.sh`).
- **Director-ratified α-path** (thread-307 round 3) — operator runs live drill; engineer documents. Decision triggered by an **honest deployment-state finding** the engineer surfaced before committing to the live drill: the running `ois-hub-local` container was on the pre-mission-48 image (SHA `7601261e8…`, started 2026-04-24 02:46 UTC, before mission-48 even activated), `STORAGE_BACKEND=gcs`, no bind mount, no `-u` uid override. The dogfood claim asserted in thread-303 + task-359 ("running this mission against the local-fs default") was honestly inaccurate — engineer's MCP traffic exercised the Hub data plane on the GCS-deployed pre-mission-48 image, NOT the local-fs cutover path.

### 3.6 T4 — Closing hygiene + idea-193 fold + closing report (this PR)

This PR. Key surfaces:

- **`deploy/README.md` consolidation** — replaces the T1/T2b/T2c-stub-accumulating §"Local-fs Hub state directory" section with three well-defined sections: `## Local-fs Hub profile` (declarative properties), `## Cutover runbook` (operator-facing comprehensive cutover procedure, pre-flight + 5 steps + verification), `## Rollback runbook` (Scenario A pure-time-travel + Scenario B preserve-post-cutover-writes; explicit `--yes` rationale; sentinel-handling note).
- **idea-193 fold (`docs/specs/entities.md`)** — `owner_store` blocks for Task + Agent migrated from the legacy `memory: ... / gcs: ...` form to the post-mission-49 `repository: <path> (via StorageProvider)` form. §3 Entity Catalog gains an introductory paragraph documenting the 12-entity `*Repository`-over-`StorageProvider` coverage. §6 contract definition updated to reflect the new owner_store semantics with a "legacy form (pre-mission-47): superseded" note.
- **idea-193 fold (`deploy/README.md` §Outstanding sweep)** — surveyed the §Outstanding bullets (7 items, all deploy-tooling-related: Hub deploy pipeline COMPLETE, Architect deploy pipeline COMPLETE, New-env bootstrap wrapper COMPLETE, end-to-end build.sh OPEN, GCS remote-state migration OPEN, Generic CloudRun lifecycle scripts OPEN, bug-30 / idea-186 narrow-gate re-require OPEN); none are storage-abstraction-debt items resolvable by mission-47/48/49. No-op sweep documented for archival completeness.
- **Optional mission-47 engineer-authored closing report SKIPPED** (engineer's call per idea-193 scope). Architect retrospective at `docs/reviews/m-sovereign-storage-interface-retrospective.md` (or equivalent) covers substance; post-hoc construction of an engineer report for an already-closed mission risks substance-drift vs the architect retrospective with low marginal archival value. Decision documented here so the call is auditable.

Actual: ~1.5 eng-days within a single uninterrupted session (timeline: T1 ~30min, T2a ~30min including fake-gsutil smoke, T2b ~25min, T2c ~30min including 5-scenario smoke, T3 ~25min including deployment-state finding + thread-307 coordination, T4 ~40min). Aligns with the M sizing band.

---

## 5. Emergent observations + side findings

### 5.1 Honest dogfood scope (T3-surfaced)

Thread-303 + task-359 framed mission-48 as its own dogfood — "every Hub state operation lands on local-fs". T3 inspection revealed the running Hub container was on the pre-mission-48 image throughout: `STORAGE_BACKEND=gcs`, no bind mount, no uid override, started before mission-48 activation. Engineer's mission-48 MCP traffic exercised the Hub data plane on the GCS-deployed pre-mission-48 image, NOT the local-fs cutover path.

This was surfaced honestly on thread-307 round 2 before committing to any live drill, leading Director to call the α-path (operator runs live drill; engineer documents). The drill outputs land back via thread-307 reply / PR amendment / retrospective per Director's direction.

**What this captures:** the dogfood-as-stated framing in design rounds works for missions whose scope is the data plane itself (mission-49 was the data plane — Repository migration that the engineer touched directly via every MCP call). For missions whose scope is the deployment configuration (mission-48 — bind mount + start-hub.sh defaults + Hub-side guards), the engineer's MCP traffic is the wrong surface to dogfood; the deployed image is. The lesson cuts at the design-round level: framing dogfood claims for deployment-config missions needs to specify what's deployed where, not just "the engineer is running it".

### 5.2 Hub redeploy not gated on mission-merge events (side finding)

Captured in `docs/runbooks/m-local-fs-cutover-drills.md` §0 + thread-307 round 2. The running Hub container had been Up for 4+ hours when T3 verification began — i.e., not redeployed across PRs #24/#25/#26/#27 merges. Mission-48 work merged to main but not to any deployed image until operator-side `build-hub.sh` runs.

This is a CD-pipeline concern (architect ack'd on thread-307 round 3; will file as a discrete idea post-mission-48-close). Distinct from idea-191 (GH event bridge into Hub) and idea-192 (Hub-side triggers + inbox); benefits-from both but its own scope.

**What this captures:** the laptop-Hub deployment pattern is operator-driven (manual `build-hub.sh` + `start-hub.sh`); there's no auto-redeploy gated on PR merge. For missions whose scope assumes "the merged code is running" (like mission-48's dogfood claim), this gap matters. The fix lives in CD-pipeline territory.

### 5.3 ADR-024 §6.1 amendment scope discipline

The amendment narrowly reclassifies `local-fs` for single-writer-laptop-prod. Multi-writer / Cloud Run targets must continue to use `STORAGE_BACKEND=gcs` because the `concurrent:false` capability flag still rules out multi-writer profiles by contract. The amendment is operationally enforceable via deployment discipline (start-hub.sh:148-161 one-hub-at-a-time check); the contract-level capability flag remains accurate.

**What this captures:** ADR amendments work cleanly when the change is a deployment-context reclassification rather than a contract change. The `capabilities.concurrent` flag from ADR-024 §2.3 didn't need to change — what changed was the deployment context in which `concurrent:false` is acceptable.

### 5.4 Mission-49 prerequisite satisfaction

Mission-48's success-criterion 1 ("audit + notification durability post-cutover") was inherited from mission-49's W8/W9 Repository migrations. Mission-49 closed 2026-04-25 with all 12 entity stores migrated to `*Repository` over `StorageProvider`; mission-48's β-split sequence rolled forward onto a foundation where the durability gap was structurally closed. The β-split sequencing decision (thread-303 round 5) was the right call vs the (α) bundled alternative — it kept each mission's debug surface narrow and the tele story clean.

## 8. Mission close summary

mission-48 (M-Local-FS-Cutover) closes the β-split sequence opened by mission-49's prerequisite migration. The two-mission arc — mission-49 (Audit + Notification Repository migration) + mission-48 (cutover) — was Director-ratified on thread-303 round 5 as the cleaner alternative to a single bundled mission, citing tele-3 story clarity, debug-surface narrowing, mission-47 wave-pattern continuation, and honest sizing.

Both missions shipped in a single uninterrupted engineer-side session 2026-04-25 (mission-49 ~5.5 hours; mission-48 ~6 hours). All 14 PRs across the two missions (mission-49 #21+#22+#23 + mission-48 #24-#28+T4) ship-green per the bug-32 CI pattern. The 6-primitive `StorageProvider` contract from ADR-024 held throughout — extended only by the §6.1 local-fs profile-reclassification amendment, no contract surface widening.

Engineer-side scope closes when this T4 PR merges. Mission status `completed` flip + retrospective + operator drill remain on architect/Director side.
