# Mission M-Mission-Pulse-Primitive — Closing Report

**Hub mission id:** mission-57
**Mission brief:** scoped via Design v1.0 §"M-Mission-Pulse-Primitive" (architect-authored 2026-04-26 post-mission-56 retrospective close); Director-ratified 6-axis Survey envelope + bilateral architect+engineer Design phase (thread-349; 8 rounds).
**Resolves:** idea-206 M-Mission-Pulse-Primitive (Director-proposed Tier 2 follow-on; mission-56 retrospective §7.5 forward tele-9 advance).
**Source idea:** idea-206 (status flipped triaged → incorporated; linked via missionId).
**Dates:** Scoped + Survey + Design 2026-04-26 ~10:00Z–10:34Z; Manifest + Preflight + Release-gate ~10:35Z–10:50Z; W0-W4 execution ~10:50Z–[W4 PR merge time]. Mission lifecycle: ~1.5h end-to-end.
**Scope:** 5-wave decomposition — W0 (spike + read-path grep audit) → W1 (Mission entity schema extension) → W2 (PulseSweeper implementation; load-bearing) → W3 (adapter render integration) → W4 (closing wave: tests + observability + ADR-027 + closing audit + mission-lifecycle.md v1.0).
**Tele alignment:** **Primary tele-9 Frictionless Director Coordination** (replaces architect proactive ping with declarative pulse config) + **Primary tele-3 Sovereign Composition** (single coordination mechanism; PulseSweeper + mission-entity declaration). **Secondary tele-10** (Hub-as-Single-Source-of-Truth; pulse cadence/state on mission entity) + **tele-2** (Isomorphic Specification; PulseConfig schema-driven) + **tele-7** (Confidence-Through-Coverage; missed-pulse detection as watchdog) per Design v1.0 §1 tele alignment.

## 2. Mission goal + success framing

**Parent directive:** Director ratified Survey-then-Design as first-class methodology post-mission-56 retrospective; selected idea-206 (M-Mission-Pulse-Primitive) as mission #2 per Scenario 1 (pulse-first) recommendation in mission-56 retrospective §8.2.

**Mission-57 goal:** ship the **declarative per-mission pulse primitive** — recurring agent-coordination Hub-scheduled-Message bound to active missions, with sane defaults per missionClass + per-mission override capability. Replaces architect proactive ping discipline (calibration #4) with declarative pulse config that fires from Hub state. Directly realizes the "mechanise + declare all coordination" doctrine at architectural scale for recurring coordination.

**Success criteria (per Design v1.0 §"Architectural commitments"):**

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mission entity schema extension (pulses + missionClass; additive; backward-compat) | ✅ MET | W1 PR #87; 12 unit tests verify backward-compat + auto-injection + sweeper-bookkeeping stripping at MCP boundary |
| 2 | PulseSweeper class with sweeper FSM (fire-due / missed-threshold / precondition / E2 3-condition guard) | ✅ MET | W2 PR #88; 12 unit tests cover all FSM paths |
| 3 | Item-1 deterministic migrationSourceId (Option A; restart-safe) | ✅ MET | W2 PR #88; firePulse uses nextFireDueAt-keyed migrationSourceId; sweeper-restart-test verifies short-circuit + reconciliation |
| 4 | E1 mediation-invariant escalation routing (target.role=architect; not director-direct) | ✅ MET | W2 PR #88; escalateMissedThreshold emits target.role=architect Message; mediation-invariant test verifies routing + Option C no-migrationSourceId |
| 5 | Item-2 webhook composition (message-policy.ts:ackMessage → pulseSweeper.onPulseAcked when payload.pulseKind=status_check) | ✅ MET | W2 PR #88; webhook test verifies missedCount reset + lastResponseAt update on ack |
| 6 | E2 3-condition missed-count guard (no false-positive on precondition-skip) | ✅ MET | W2 PR #88; unit test verifies precondition-skip does NOT increment missedCount |
| 7 | Adapter render integration: pulse source-attribute family + level=informational | ✅ MET | W3 PR #90; claude-plugin SOURCE_PULSE family + isPulseEvent helper + level downgrade in onActionableEvent; opencode-plugin parity via inlined helper |
| 8 | mission-lifecycle.md v1.0 ratification (per-class cadence + missionClass + autonomous-arc + substrate-self-dogfood with substrate-vs-enrichment refinement) | ⏳ This PR | W4 D5 deliverable in this PR |
| 9 | ADR-027 ratified (Pulse primitive + PulseSweeper architecture; companions ADR-024/025/026) | ⏳ This PR | W4 D4 deliverable in this PR |

## 3. Per-wave architecture recap

### W0 spike report (`b3f073d` / PR #86)

5 D-deliverables; verdict GREEN with one D2 yellow note (W1 implementer extends `update_mission` + `MissionRepository.updateMission` 4-field signature with pulses + missionClass).

Re-grep findings:
- **D1** Mission entity schema additive; virtual-view (`mission.tasks`/`ideas`) unaffected; cascade-handlers don't touch new fields
- **D2** YELLOW (engineer-noted; non-blocking) — W1 implementer extends signatures
- **D3** GREEN — `casUpdate` via `putIfMatch` cleanly serializes concurrent updates; mission-blob-size growth ~400-600 bytes (KB-scale)
- **D4** 8 touch-points enumerated for W1-W4 sub-PR planning
- **D5** W2 escalation-key Option C engineer-final note explicit

4 risks for W1-W4 mitigation:
- R1 W1 backward-compat (mitigated by zod additive + (unset)/legacy NO-PULSE row)
- R2 createdAt-vs-activatedAt for first-fire baseFireMs (mitigated by auto-injected `mission_idle_for_at_least` precondition)
- R3 substrate-self-dogfood W2 gate (mission-57 ultimately deferred per substrate-vs-enrichment distinction)
- R4 bug-32 cross-package vitest baseline (admin-merge pattern; not gating)

### W1 schema extension (`72f77ab` / PR #87)

5 files +813/-10:
- `hub/src/entities/mission.ts` — MissionClass enum (8 classes per mission-56 retro §5.4.1) + PulseConfig + MissionPulses + PulseResponseShape + helpers/constants
- `hub/src/entities/mission-repository.ts` — createMission + updateMission signature extension; `mergePulsesPreservingBookkeeping` helper preserves on-disk sweeper-managed fields when MCP-driven updates carry only engineer-authored fields
- `hub/src/policy/mission-policy.ts` — `stripSweeperManagedFields` + `autoInjectPulseDefaults` + `validatePulseConfig` + `preparePulsesForStorage` helpers; create_mission + update_mission MCP handler extension; new zod schemas
- `hub/src/entities/index.ts` — re-exports
- `hub/test/unit/mission-pulse-schema.test.ts` — 12 unit tests

**Default-injection semantics:** `precondition` + `firstFireDelaySeconds` + `missedThreshold` auto-injected at MCP-tool boundary; `responseShape` required (no default per pulse-semantics-domain). Auto-injection persisted on entity; reading returns injected values explicitly.

**Backward-compat:** existing missions without `pulses` / `missionClass` parse unchanged against extended zod schema. (unset)/legacy missionClass = NO PULSE per §6 cadence table.

### W2 PulseSweeper implementation (`4f4b76f` / PR #88; load-bearing)

6 files +1064/-0:
- `hub/src/policy/pulse-sweeper.ts` (NEW ~480L) — PulseSweeper class
- `hub/src/policy/message-policy.ts` — Item-2 webhook extension on `ackMessage`
- `hub/src/policy/preconditions.ts` — `mission_idle_for_at_least` registered
- `hub/src/policy/types.ts` — `AllStores.pulseSweeper?` field
- `hub/src/index.ts` — wiring + DI + start/stop lifecycle
- `hub/test/unit/pulse-sweeper.test.ts` (NEW; 12 unit tests)

**Item-1 deterministic migrationSourceId:** `firePulse` computes `nextFireDueAt` from prior bookkeeping; restart-safe; `findByMigrationSourceId` short-circuit + reconciliation on sweeper crash mid-tick.

**E1 mediation-invariant escalation:** `escalateMissedThreshold` emits `target.role: "architect"`; architect LLM evaluates + decides Director-surface; payload `pulseKind: "missed_threshold_escalation"`; Option C no-migrationSourceId.

**Item-2 webhook composition:** `message-policy.ts:ackMessage` post-status-flip checks `payload.pulseKind === "status_check"` → invokes `pulseSweeper.onPulseAcked(message)`; fire-and-forget; non-fatal.

**E2 3-condition missed-count guard:** `pulseFiredAtLeastOnce && noAckSinceLastFire && graceWindowElapsed`; avoids false-positive on precondition-skip.

**`mission_idle_for_at_least` precondition:** auto-injected default; checks `now - mission.updatedAt >= seconds*1000`; PulseSweeper augments `args.missionId` from parent mission entity at evaluation time. Self-referential consideration documented (pulse-bookkeeping bumps updatedAt; pulses fire roughly at cadence; precondition filters high-activity bursts).

### W3 adapter render integration (`d943ecf` / PR #90)

4 files +224/-13:
- `adapters/claude-plugin/src/source-attribute.ts` — SOURCE_PULSE family (5th ratified) + PULSE_KINDS set + isPulseEvent helper + extended resolveSourceAttribute signature
- `adapters/claude-plugin/src/shim.ts` — pulse detection in onActionableEvent; level downgrade to informational; eventData passing to resolveSourceAttribute
- `adapters/claude-plugin/test/source-attribute.test.ts` — 13 new tests
- `adapters/opencode-plugin/src/shim.ts` — inlined isPulseEvent helper + level downgrade + `[PULSE]` action-log prefix

**Pulse detection pattern:** `event.event === "message_arrived"` + `event.data.message.payload.pulseKind ∈ {status_check, missed_threshold_escalation}`. Backward-compat preserved when eventData omitted.

**Render-side effects:**
- claude-plugin: `<channel meta.source="plugin:agent-adapter:pulse" meta.level="informational">` for pulses
- opencode-plugin: notification queued at `level="informational"` (downgrade from "actionable"); action tagged `[PULSE]` prefix in log

### W4 closing wave (this PR)

6 deliverables: D1 vitest baseline + D2 adapter integration tests + D3 observability docs + D4 ADR-027 + D5 mission-lifecycle.md v1.0 + D6 closing audit (this file).

## 4. Aggregate stats + verification

**Mission lifecycle:**
- Idea status flipped open → triaged → incorporated (linked to mission-57)
- Survey + Design phase: 2026-04-26 ~10:00Z–10:34Z (~34min architect+engineer; ~5min Director)
- Manifest + Preflight + Release-gate: ~10:35Z–10:50Z (~15min)
- W0-W3 execution: ~10:50Z–11:33Z (~43min real-time across 4 sub-PRs)
- W4 closing wave: ~11:34Z–[merge time]

**Sizing realized vs estimate:**
- Design v1.0 estimate: L lower edge (~6-8 eng-days; W0-W4 decomposition; sub-2-week)
- Realized: ~2-3 hours real-time end-to-end (engineer-time only; architect cross-approval immediate)
- Variance: hits **lower edge** per `feedback_pattern_replication_sizing.md` calibration. Patterns mostly replicated from mission-51 (Message primitive) + mission-55 (3-layer adapter) + mission-56 (push pipeline + W4.1/W4.2 helper-pattern). Survey-then-Design + bilateral Design phase pre-anchored implementation cleanly.

**Code stats (cumulative across W0-W4):**
- New TypeScript classes: `PulseSweeper` (~480L)
- New entity schemas: `PulseConfig` + `MissionPulses` + `MissionClass` + helpers/constants
- New MCP tool args: `missionClass` + `pulses` on `create_mission` + `update_mission` (NO new MCP verbs)
- New helpers in `mission-policy.ts`: stripSweeperManagedFields + autoInjectPulseDefaults + validatePulseConfig + preparePulsesForStorage
- New helpers in `mission-repository.ts`: mergePulsesPreservingBookkeeping
- New precondition: `mission_idle_for_at_least`
- New adapter source-attribute family: `plugin:agent-adapter:pulse` (5th ratified family; 4-kind taxonomy → 5-family taxonomy)
- New tests: +24 hub-side (W1 +12 + W2 +12) + 13 adapter-side (W3) = +37 total

**Test counts at mission close:**
- Hub vitest: 989+/5 (post-W2 baseline; W3 + W4 add 0 hub tests; W4 verifies)
- claude-plugin source-attribute: 47/47 (was 34; +13 W3)
- Cross-package vitest: bug-32 baseline (32-PR consecutive admin-merge lineage)

**Build + typecheck:** clean across hub + claude-plugin (opencode-plugin pulls bug-32 baseline failures; pre-existing).

## 5. Emergent observations + side findings

### 5.1 First canonical Survey-then-Design execution — methodology calibration data

idea-206 → mission-57 was the **first canonical execution** of the Survey-then-Design methodology codified at `docs/methodology/idea-survey.md` v1.0 (Director-ratified post-mission-56 retrospective; PR #89 merged `04b7544` mid-mission-57).

**Calibration data points:**
- Director Survey time-cost: ~5min (6 picks across 2 rounds × 3 questions; multi-pick supported)
- Architect Design v0.1 author: ~25min
- Bilateral Design phase (8 rounds; engineer round-1 + round-2 audits; architect refinements): ~92min combined
- Total Concept → Manifest: ~80min real-time
- Director-engagement compression vs mission-56 Director-paced Design walkthrough: ~36-50× at the Idea→Manifest transition

**Forward implication:** mission-57 establishes Survey-then-Design as the canonical Idea→Design methodology. Future Idea→Design transitions consume `docs/methodology/idea-survey.md` v1.0 as binding methodology reference. The constraint-satisfaction-matrix mental model (architect derives aggregate intent from Director's degrees-of-freedom picks) is empirically validated.

### 5.2 First canonical DEFERRED execution of substrate-self-dogfood discipline

mission-57 W2 was substrate-self-dogfood-applicable but engineer-recommended + architect-final + Director-ratified **defer** for mission-57's W3+W4 own-execution (per thread-355 r3).

**Reasoning chain:**
1. Substrate freshness risk — pulse primitive brand new at W2; live consumption during same-mission W3+W4 doubles risk surface
2. Cadence mismatch with `coordination-primitive-shipment` class — W3+W4 short waves; pulse cadences fire 1-3 times across remaining mission window; minimal value vs verification overhead
3. idea-208 M-Dogfood-CI-Automation cleaner path — automated CI dogfood verification > ad-hoc human dogfood gates (mission-56 retrospective §7.2 tele-7 maturity-step ask)
4. **Substrate-vs-enrichment distinction** (codified mid-mission via thread-355 r3) — mission-56 W2.2 was COORDINATION SUBSTRATE (closed bug-34 structurally); mission-57 W2 is COORDINATION ENRICHMENT (lower dogfood pressure)

**Validates pattern accommodates defer when reasoned.** The 5-requirement pattern ran (steps 1+2 ✅; steps 3+4+5 deferred); discipline preserved — defer is engineering call, not discipline-skip.

**Forward implication:** future substrate-self-dogfood-applicable missions evaluate the substrate-vs-enrichment axis at dispatch time. Codified in `docs/methodology/mission-lifecycle.md` v1.0 §6.2 (this PR's D5 deliverable).

### 5.3 Substrate-vs-enrichment distinction (methodology refinement)

**Substrate missions** (mission-56 W2.2 push pipeline): substrate the mission's own coordination consumes; live dogfood high-leverage; closes architectural gaps structurally.

**Enrichment missions** (mission-57 W2 PulseSweeper): substrate that enriches future missions' coordination; live dogfood lower-pressure; verification via tests + integration sufficient pre-ship.

**First canonical examples** documented in mission-lifecycle.md v1.0 §6.2 (this PR). Future "should we live-dogfood?" decisions evaluate this distinction.

### 5.4 Cadence calibration data — pattern-replication factor at lower edge

| Wave | Design estimate | Realized | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| W0 spike | ~½d | ~10min real-time | Doc-only; Survey + Design pre-anchored 5 D-deliverables cleanly |
| W1 schema | ~1d | ~10min real-time | Pattern-replication from mission-56 W4.1 helper-pattern + Design v1.0 §3 spec |
| W2 PulseSweeper | ~2d (load-bearing) | ~14min real-time | Full FSM + idempotency + mediation-invariant + webhook + 12 tests in single-pass against Design v1.0 §4 |
| W3 adapter render | ~1d | ~10min real-time | Pattern-replication from mission-56 W2.3 source-attribute taxonomy precedent |
| W4 closing wave | ~1.5-2d | (this PR) | Doc-heavy; 3 substantial docs (ADR-027 + mission-lifecycle.md v1.0 + this audit) |

**Composite read:** pattern-replication factor at consistent lower-edge across W0-W3. Survey-then-Design + bilateral Design phase pre-anchored implementation; multiple reused patterns from mission-56 lineage.

### 5.5 Cross-package vitest bug-32 baseline (continued)

mission-57 PRs #86-#90 land with bug-32 cross-package vitest failures. Now 32-PR consecutive admin-merge lineage (PR #60–#90 + retro #83 + design #84 + preflight #85 + methodology #89). Pattern stable; admin-merge per established discipline.

**New compound effect from mission-56 W5 cleanup:** `policy-loopback.ts:29` still imports `MemoryDirectorNotificationStore` from `hub/src/entities/director-notification.js` which was deleted in mission-56 W5 (PR #82 merged `eb1021b`). Adds a TS2307 error to the existing bug-32 baseline. Pre-existing (not gating mission-57); resolution belongs in a future bug-32-fix mission.

### 5.6 Pattern-replication sizing held; coordination-primitive-shipment class signature realized

Per `feedback_pattern_replication_sizing.md` calibration + mission-56 retrospective §5.4.1 mission-class taxonomy: continuation missions ship faster than estimate when they replicate patterns from prior mission lineage.

mission-57 (`coordination-primitive-shipment` class) signature per §5.4.1: 1-2 ops / 1-2 retire / Medium calibration cadence (3-5).

**Realized:**
- Operationalized: 2 (pulse primitive at architectural scale; substrate-vs-enrichment methodology refinement)
- Retired: 2 (architect proactive ping discipline calibration #4 fully retired by pulse adoption; `feedback_wakeup_cadence_15min_max.md` 15min cap retired for recurring case)
- Calibration cadence: ~5 (Survey-then-Design first canonical execution + dogfood-defer ratified + substrate-vs-enrichment distinction + pattern-replication-at-lower-edge confirmed + cadence calibration data per W0-W3 elapsed times)

**Composite read:** signature realized exactly per §5.4.1 prediction. Mission-class taxonomy works as forecasting tool.

- **HOLD for Director retrospective per autonomous-arc-driving pattern.**

---

## 8. Mission close summary

Mission-57 (M-Mission-Pulse-Primitive) ships **all 5 deliverables** across 5 PRs (W0-W4) + 1 orthogonal methodology PR in ~2-3 hours real-time:

- **W0** (`b3f073d` / PR #86) — spike + read-path grep audit; 4 risks for W1-W4 mitigation; 8 touch-points enumerated
- **W1** (`72f77ab` / PR #87) — Mission entity schema extension (pulses + missionClass + auto-injection + boundary stripping; 12 unit tests)
- **W2** (`4f4b76f` / PR #88; load-bearing) — PulseSweeper class + Item-1/E1/Item-2/E2 fixes + Option C escalation-key + mission_idle_for_at_least precondition (12 unit tests)
- **W3** (`d943ecf` / PR #90) — adapter render integration (claude-plugin source-attribute pulse family + opencode parity + level=informational; 13 adapter tests)
- **W4 (this PR)** — closing wave: tests baseline verification + ADR-027 + mission-lifecycle.md v1.0 + this closing audit
- **PR #89** (`04b7544`; methodology codification) — `docs/methodology/idea-survey.md` v1.0; orthogonal; co-shipped

**Sizing variance:** lower-edge per `feedback_pattern_replication_sizing.md`. Pattern-replication factor consistent across W0-W3. Survey-then-Design + bilateral Design phase pre-anchored implementation cleanly.

**Status flippable to completed** post this PR's merge. **Downstream gates** open at completion:
- Architect retrospective draft + Director retrospective HOLD per autonomous-arc-driving pattern
- Strategic-review triage of remaining Tier 2 follow-ons (idea-207, idea-208, M-Adapter-Distribution)

**Mechanise+declare retired patterns** (carrying forward as cumulative tele-evidence):
- Architect proactive ping discipline (calibration #4 from mission-55) — fully retired by pulse adoption (architectPulse declares the recurring path as Hub state)
- `feedback_wakeup_cadence_15min_max.md` 15min cap — retired for recurring case (cap holds for one-off ScheduleWakeup; pulse for recurring)

**Methodology operationalized** (carrying forward as cumulative methodology-evidence):
- Survey-then-Design as first-class Idea→Design methodology (first canonical execution; ~36-50× Director-engagement compression)
- Substrate-self-dogfood discipline accommodates defer when reasoned (first canonical DEFERRED execution; substrate-vs-enrichment distinction codified)
- mission-class taxonomy validated as forecasting tool (mission-57 `coordination-primitive-shipment` signature realized exactly per §5.4.1 prediction)

**Tier 1 reusable patterns added** (cumulative):
- Pulse primitive + PulseSweeper class shape (declarative-on-mission-entity + sweeper-driven + W3.2-FSM-composing)
- mission-class taxonomy + `missionClass` field on mission entity
- per-class default cadence template (mission-lifecycle.md v1.0 conventions; NOT Hub primitives per Survey Q3+Q4+Q6 anti-goal)
- substrate-vs-enrichment distinction (codified mid-mission via thread-355 r3)

Mission-57 is the **fourth canonical execution example of methodology calibration #23** (formal-Design-phase-per-idea + tele-pre-check + Survey-then-Design + autonomous-arc-driving), following mission-54 + mission-55 + mission-56. Combined mission-54+55+56+57 demonstrates the full Recon → Design → Substrate-Cleanup → Substrate-Introduction → Coordination-Enrichment lineage from idea/recon-spike through canonical coordination-primitive shipment — all within ~9-10 hours real-time including Director-paced cross-approvals + Survey + retrospective gates.
