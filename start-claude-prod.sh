# start-claude.sh — Launch a Claude Code session wired to the local
# agent-adapter plugin, under a named identity.
#
# The name is exported as OIS_INSTANCE_ID, which the plugin's handshake
# passes to the Hub as globalInstanceId. Distinct names → distinct
# agentIds, so two Claude sessions on the same laptop can coexist as
# independent engineers (required for engineer↔engineer peer threads).
#
# idea-251: also exported as OIS_AGENT_NAME, which surfaces in get_agents
# as the display-name (NAME column). Setting both keeps identity and
# display name aligned for operator readability.
#
# Usage: ./start-claude.sh <name>
# Example: ./start-claude.sh kate
#
