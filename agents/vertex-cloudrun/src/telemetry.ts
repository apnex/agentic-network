/**
 * Architect-side cognitive telemetry singleton.
 *
 * Phase 2a ckpt-C bridge (thread-160): surfaces Gemini per-round usage
 * as first-class `llm_usage` events through the shared
 * CognitiveTelemetry sink, so architect-side LLM accounting lands in
 * the same pipe as tool-call telemetry.
 *
 * Used by:
 *   - sandwich.ts  (thread-reply REASON loop)
 *   - director-chat.ts  (session REASON loop)
 *
 * Sink strategy (Phase 2a):
 *   - One structured-JSON console.log per event, prefix `[ArchitectTelemetry]`.
 *   - Cloud Run ingests console output as structured log entries; easy
 *     to grep + eventually route to BigQuery / Cloud Trace without
 *     touching shim code.
 *
 * Follow-ups:
 *   - Persist Virtual Tokens Saved aggregates to GCS / Hub once we
 *     build a cross-session dashboard.
 *   - Optionally expose a sink-override so tests and local dev can
 *     replace the default logger with an in-memory collector.
