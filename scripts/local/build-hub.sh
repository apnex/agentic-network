# scripts/local/build-hub.sh — Build the Hub container image via Cloud
# Build for the selected env, then pull it locally and tag as
# `ois-hub:local` so scripts/local/start-hub.sh can run it.
#
# Source: hub/ in this repo. Build context is the local hub/ directory;
# you do NOT need to push to GitHub first (gcloud builds submit uploads
# sources).
#
# Idempotent: running twice rebuilds + re-pulls. Remote tag is :latest
# in the selected env's Artifact Registry; local Docker tag is always
# `ois-hub:local` (single tag matches one-hub-at-a-time policy in
# start-hub.sh — switching envs = rebuild + restart).
#
# Usage:
#   OIS_ENV=<env> scripts/local/build-hub.sh
#   scripts/local/build-hub.sh              # OIS_ENV defaults to prod
#
# Env selection (mission-46 T1):
#   OIS_ENV     — selects which tfvars file to read. Default: prod.
#                 Must match ^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$, max 20 chars.
#   GCP_PROJECT — project id override (takes precedence over tfvars)
#   GCP_REGION  — region override (fallback: australia-southeast1)
#
# tfvars discovery order (first existing wins for OIS_ENV=<env>):
#   1. deploy/cloudrun/env/<env>.tfvars
#   2. deploy/env/<env>.tfvars

# ── Sovereign-package tarball staging (mission-50 T1+T5; task-386 ext.) ─
#
# Hub depends on multiple sovereign packages via `file:../packages/...`
# refs in hub/package.json. Those refs work for local dev
# (`cd hub && npm install`) but not for Cloud Build: the build context
# is hub/ only — `..` escapes the upload.
#
# Pre-build hook: for each sovereign package, `npm pack` it into hub/
# as a tarball and rewrite the corresponding `file:../packages/<pkg>`
# ref in a transient hub/package.json swap to `file:./<tarball>`, then
# let `gcloud builds submit hub/` upload the prepared directory. The
# container resolves its own dep tree at build time (Dockerfile uses
# `npm install`, not `npm ci`). A trap on EXIT/INT/TERM/HUP restores
# package.json and removes ALL staged tarballs, so committed state
# stays clean even on signal interrupt.
#
# Adding a sovereign package = append one entry to SOVEREIGN_PACKAGES
# below + add matching `COPY ois-<pkg>-*.tgz ./` lines to hub/Dockerfile
# (both stages) + add matching exclusion to hub/.gitignore + add matching
# `!ois-<pkg>-*.tgz` re-include to hub/.gcloudignore.
#
# Why the script does NOT regenerate hub/package-lock.json (bug-38, T5):
# Earlier mission-50 iterations regenerated the lockfile on the host
# before the gcloud upload (T1: `npm install --package-lock-only`; T4:
# full `npm install`). Both produced lockfiles that were structurally
# fragile against (a) host-vs-container npm/node version drift (host
# npm 11 / node 24 vs container npm 10 / node 22), (b) registry state
# at regen time (different runs produced different @emnapi/* version
# pinnings), and (c) operator-environment variation (different hosts
# produce different lockfiles for identical inputs). The Cloud Build
# container demanded multiple @emnapi/* versions simultaneously that
# host-side regen could not consistently produce. T5 removed host-side
# regen entirely; the container does its own resolution against the
# swap-modified package.json (file:./tarball ref) using its own
# toolchain. Tradeoff: Dockerfile uses `npm install` not `npm ci` for
# the build path, so strict lockfile-validation is removed for that
# path — acceptable because the lockfile was already transient (regen
# per build before T5; never reaching commit-state-strictness anyway)
# and `cd hub && npm install` local dev keeps using the committed
# lockfile via the file:../packages/<pkg> refs.
#
# TODO(idea-186): When npm workspaces lands, this transient-swap hook
# becomes obsolete — workspaces resolve internal packages without
# tarball staging. Sunset condition: idea-186 ratified + Hub migrated
# to workspace resolution. At that point, delete this entire section,
# the `COPY ois-<pkg>-*.tgz` lines from hub/Dockerfile (one per
# sovereign package), the tarball exclusions from hub/.gitignore, and
# hub/.gcloudignore; the Dockerfile's `npm install` reverts to `npm ci`
# for strict lockfile-validation against the committed
# (workspaces-resolved) lockfile.
#
